Flip flops</h2><p>First up is flip flops.</p><p>They might be handy to slip on when it's hot, but they pose several dangers, according to British podiatrist Paul, who is based at My FootDr in <a href=#>Singapore</a>.</p><p>He said: "When you put your foot through the loops, you have to grip and that can cause claw toeing.</p><p>"Also, when you're walking down the street, it's very easy to trip and fall when you're wearing them.</p><p>"They don't offer your feet any support."</p><p>Claw toe, similar to hammer toe, is a foot deformity often caused by wearing shoes that squeeze your toes.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Health</h2></p><p>Usually, your toes are bent upward or downward, sometimes curling under, which can be incredibly painful.</p><p>Corns and calluses can form due to the pressure.</p><h2>2. Stilettos</h2><p>"The second pair of shoes I wouldn't wear are stilettos," Paul said.</p><p>"I don't want to hate on all heels because a one-and-a-half inch heel is okay for most people.</p><p>"But stilettos have such a thin base. My colleague actually fell recently and broke her foot.</p><p>"There's such a high risk of injury, is it worth it, even to look nice?"</p><h2>3. Skechers</h2><p>Paul's third choice is a brand that advertises itself as being big on "comfort and technology".</p><p>But there are three key reasons he's not a fan of Skechers.</p><p>"The first is that the slip-on variety are made tighter to hold on to your feet so can squeeze your toes and cause problems like neuromas," he said.</p><p>"The second is that they are so soft that your foot has to do more work.</p><p>"They may feel good but then later on through the day, then actually your foot is more tired.</p><p>"And the final thing is that the shoes just don't last long. They wear out so quickly.</p><p>"They may seem like a great deal but you're replacing your shoes every one to two months and I just don't think that's very good."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/3-shoes-i-never-wear-823752073.jpg><p>After sharing his insight on what not to wear, Paul was inundated with messages asking which shoes are good for your feet.</p><p>He outlined three that he uses every single week.</p><h2>1. Bared smart shoe</h2><p>For meeting doctors and going to weddings, Paul loves the smart-looking Curium shoes from the brand Bared.</p><p>His favourite thing about it is that they have removable insoles, but he's also a fan of the amount of space they provide his tootsies.</p><p>"They also have very firm heel counters, which I love, and they have a bit of a toe drop so the heel is raised and then it drops off towards the toe," he added.</p><p>"That just takes the stress off the calf, off the Achilles, and prevents a lot of foot issues."</p><h2>2. Asics Kayano</h2><p>For day-to-day, Paul goes for Asics Kayanos.</p><p>They are designed as long-distance running shoes, but he wears them to work.</p><p>"I do most of my walking in these trainers," he said.</p><p>"The great thing about these shoes is they have got a very firm heel counter which locks the ankle in place.</p><p>"Then through the arch area, through the mid-foot, they have a lot of support as I have slightly flat feet."</p><p>Paul also loves the fact they lace up, and that they are pretty broad on the toes so avoids squeezing.</p><p>"I'd use this for longer walks, the gym, going for runs and things like that," he added.</p><h2>3. Nike Air Force 1</h2><p>"The final shoes for me are the Nike Air Force 1s," Paul said.</p><p>"These are great shoes for going to the mall, going for dinner, meeting my friends and things like that.</p><p>"They're best for when I do between 2,000 and 5,000 steps.</p><p>"The great thing is they are extra wide so they doesn't squash my feet.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"They're lace-ups again, and actually, the ankle stability comes up high above the ankle so they holds the foot in place nicely.</p><p>"These are great shoes and a fantastic addition to the wardrobe."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57x56YpayYZIV0fpdpanBno528pr%2BMp5yvnaJixKat0WaZmpxdm7yzecWenK1lkaHBpr7NmquirpWofA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fshoes-never-wear-bad-for-feet-alternatives.html&text=I%27m%20a%20podiatrist%20-%20here%20are%203%20shoes%20I%20would%20NEVER%20wear...%20and%20what%20to%20go%20for%20instead&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fshoes-never-wear-bad-for-feet-alternatives.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fshoes-never-wear-bad-for-feet-alternatives.html&title=I%27m%20a%20podiatrist%20-%20here%20are%203%20shoes%20I%20would%20NEVER%20wear...%20and%20what%20to%20go%20for%20instead" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fshoes-never-wear-bad-for-feet-alternatives.html&title=I%27m%20a%20podiatrist%20-%20here%20are%203%20shoes%20I%20would%20NEVER%20wear...%20and%20what%20to%20go%20for%20instead" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fshoes-never-wear-bad-for-feet-alternatives.html&title=I%27m%20a%20podiatrist%20-%20here%20are%203%20shoes%20I%20would%20NEVER%20wear...%20and%20what%20to%20go%20for%20instead" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fshoes-never-wear-bad-for-feet-alternatives.html&description=I%27m%20a%20podiatrist%20-%20here%20are%203%20shoes%20I%20would%20NEVER%20wear...%20and%20what%20to%20go%20for%20instead" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./janet-jackson-surprises-sherri-shepherd-talk-show-video.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Janet Jackson Surprises Sherri Shepherd On Her Talk Show: Video  Hollywood Life">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./brooke-knappenberger.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Brooke Knappenberger | All their articles | Page 1">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
