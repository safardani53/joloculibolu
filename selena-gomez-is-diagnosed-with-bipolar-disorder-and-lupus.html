The actress admitted to Rolling Stone Magazine for their cover story that she suffered from psychosis in 2018 and ended up in a treatment facility after hearing voices. Soon after, the 30-year-old was diagnosed with bipolar illness, and physicians offered her a variety of drugs to see which worked best for her. However, these medications had a negative impact on her.</p><p>When asked about the side effects of the drugs, Gomez stated she felt like she was gone and that there was no part of her “that was there anymore.” Fortunately, Selena Gomez found a doctor who evaluated her prescriptions and urged her to take just two pills, which made her feel better. The actress from Another Cinderella Story claimed she had to “detox” from her meds and learn to recall sentences she would forget while speaking.&nbsp;She went on to say that accepting her bipolar disorder and learning how to cope with it was difficult since “it wasn’t going away.”</p><h2>Selena Gomez may be unable to become a mother.</h2><p>Selena Gomez admitted to Rolling Stone Magazine that she may be unable to bear a kid due to the meds she is now taking.&nbsp;The Round & Round singer collapsed in her vehicle after visiting a friend who was attempting to conceive, believing that this would not happen to her. She did, however, tell the site that she is optimistic about the issue. She remarked that it is a “very large, big, present thing” in her life and that if she is destined to have children, she will have them.&nbsp;Selena Gomez has previously spoken about her battles with mental health. She stated in 2017 that she had lupus, which led to a kidney transplant in June of that year.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Selena-Gomez-1.jpg alt width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Her friend Francia Raisa gave one of her kidneys to the Wizards of Waverly Place actress, who was hospitalized for many months after the procedure.&nbsp;Selena Gomez admitted to the tabloid that she may need another donor in a few decades since her given kidney may only function for 30 years. She continued, saying:</p><p>“It’s all right. Anyway, I may say, ‘Peace out.'”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Selena-Gomez-2.jpg alt="Selena Gomez" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Gomez also admitted in the interview that she had suicidal thoughts in her early twenties but never tried suicide.&nbsp;She said that she was in four treatment facilities when things became “very dark” and she didn’t feel in control of her emotions, both good and negative. Gomez said that she believes the world would be a better place if she were not around.&nbsp;According to Today, Gomez began shooting her newest documentary, My Mind and Me, when she was 24 years old. The six-year documentary was also shot during the Covid-19 epidemic and will be published on Apple+ on November 4, 2022.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiqnqSVo65us86mnLNlmah6pbXAoKWoq5WZeri106Fkm6GgpLmivoydoKynopmys3nAp5tmpKWlwrR7</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fselena-gomez-is-diagnosed-with-bipolar-disorder-and-lupus.html&text=Selena%20Gomez%20Is%20Diagnosed%20With%20Bipolar%20Disorder%20And%20Lupus&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fselena-gomez-is-diagnosed-with-bipolar-disorder-and-lupus.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fselena-gomez-is-diagnosed-with-bipolar-disorder-and-lupus.html&title=Selena%20Gomez%20Is%20Diagnosed%20With%20Bipolar%20Disorder%20And%20Lupus" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fselena-gomez-is-diagnosed-with-bipolar-disorder-and-lupus.html&title=Selena%20Gomez%20Is%20Diagnosed%20With%20Bipolar%20Disorder%20And%20Lupus" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fselena-gomez-is-diagnosed-with-bipolar-disorder-and-lupus.html&title=Selena%20Gomez%20Is%20Diagnosed%20With%20Bipolar%20Disorder%20And%20Lupus" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fselena-gomez-is-diagnosed-with-bipolar-disorder-and-lupus.html&description=Selena%20Gomez%20Is%20Diagnosed%20With%20Bipolar%20Disorder%20And%20Lupus" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./stormi-websters-most-fashionable-adorable-outfits.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Stormi Webster's Most Fashionable, Adorable Outfits">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./turquoise-superyacht-covered-in-jewels-would-make-liberace-proud.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Inside stunning turquoise superyacht covered in jewels that would make Liberace proud">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
