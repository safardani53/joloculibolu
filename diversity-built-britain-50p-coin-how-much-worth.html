For example in August the same coin sold for £10 after getting 12 bids, which just goes to show that interest can change over time.</p><h2>Is my change worth anything?</h2><p>Coins with a low mintage or an error are often deemed the most valuable by collectors, so spot one of these in your change and you could be quids-in.</p><p>An easy way to spot one is to look out for&nbsp;unique designs&nbsp;on the change kicking about in your wallet.</p><p>Usually the images found on the obverse will have been created to commemorate an event or location, along with a period of time in history.</p><p>There is a whole&nbsp;collection of rare Olympic 50p coins&nbsp;for example that can fetch a pretty penny on eBay, you might find some of these crop up in your change since their introduction after the London 2012 games.</p><p>But it's not only that, rare&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">error coins</a>&nbsp;are just as popular with collectors.</p><p>You can check how much the coin is selling for on eBay, by searching the full name of the coin, select the "sold" listing and then toggle the search to "highest value".</p><p>That way you get an idea of the value of a coin but sometimes a coin may not have sold for the amount is was listed for.</p><p>You can also get your change verified by The Royal Mint if you think it may be worth something, that'll also help reassure buyers that they're paying for the real deal - and you may even be able to hike up the price a bit if you go to sell.</p><p>You'll also find that online tools from change experts like&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Coin Hunter</a>&nbsp;are helpful to see how much it could be worth.</p><p>But you should always be wary of&nbsp;fakes&nbsp;circulating online, these won't be worth as much in value so you could end up cashing out on the wrong thing or disappointed that your change isn't worth as much as you thought.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p><strong>Do you have a money problem that needs sorting?
