He also came from a Hollywood family, with a director dad named Alex Matter. His mom, Paula Feiten, worked as a model too.</p><p>The 53-year-old initially shied away from photography, and he played baseball in college. After graduating, he considered pursuing acting, but soon fell into taking pictures. He later explained that his acting background helped him realize what angles worked for pictures.</p><p>His inspiration came from French humanist photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson, which led him to become more interested in pursuing photography full-time.&nbsp;</p><p>His career really took off after he took modeling headshots for some of his friends. His work gained a reputation, and he slowly began to take on more photography jobs. &nbsp;</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Eventually, modeling agents began seeking Jordan out, and recommending him to clients. He's since photographed for most of the major networks, including CBS, NBC, MSNBC, BBC, and he's done appearances on Today and The Tyra Banks Show.</p><p>Jordan is also savvy with social media. His TikTok page has over a million followers, and he's gotten more than 21 million likes on his content. His signature video is a 30-second countdown, during which he photographs a TikTok star and shows off the final shots. &nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>He's a published author as well, and he's created several books that show off his photography.

He's worked with Charli multiple times before the Santa Monica video, including when she visited New York City.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>The married photographer's YouTube channel has just over 3.7 million subscribers, and he often features videos of his two kids, Salish and Hudson on it.&nbsp;</p><p>Jordan has 1.4 million followers on Instagram, where he shared some behind the scenes looks at his Hype House photography video.&nbsp;</p><p>Though she's arguably TikTok's biggest star right now, Charli was starstruck by getting to work with Jordan.</p><p>"I've seen all of your TikToks on my "For You" page," she told the photographer when they met.&nbsp;</p><p>Watch Jordan take photos of Charli and her friends below!</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecisZKOnopmur3nMmqutnaI%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-jordan-matter.html&text=Who%20Is%20Jordan%20Matter%3f%20The%20Dance%20Photographer%20Works%20With%20Hype%20House&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-jordan-matter.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-jordan-matter.html&title=Who%20Is%20Jordan%20Matter%3f%20The%20Dance%20Photographer%20Works%20With%20Hype%20House" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-jordan-matter.html&title=Who%20Is%20Jordan%20Matter%3f%20The%20Dance%20Photographer%20Works%20With%20Hype%20House" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-jordan-matter.html&title=Who%20Is%20Jordan%20Matter%3f%20The%20Dance%20Photographer%20Works%20With%20Hype%20House" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-jordan-matter.html&description=Who%20Is%20Jordan%20Matter%3f%20The%20Dance%20Photographer%20Works%20With%20Hype%20House" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./armie-hammer-new-photos-cannibal-sexual-assault-documentary.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Armie Hammer goes shirtless &amp;amp; reveals new tattoo on rare outing before new doc explores cannibal &amp;amp; s">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./czetxyg0x0pnqha1p-svkpk2vjbnelk7.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Watch Black Ink Crew Chicago Season 7 Episode 18: I Love Lisa and Lisa Loves Me Back">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
