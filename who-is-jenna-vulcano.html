Her parents divorced when she was very young, but this rumor cannot be true because her parents appear to be still together and support their children and their dreams in life.</p><h2>Quick Facts</h2><table id=factsDetail class=highlight><tbody><tr><td><strong>Full Name</strong></td><td><strong>Jenna Vulcano</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Date of Birth</strong></td><td>August 04, 1986</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Age</strong></td><td>37 Year</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Height/How tall?<br></strong></td><td class=quick-facts-td2>N/A</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Profession</strong></td><td>American actress, and comedienne</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Father Name</strong></td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Mother Name</strong></td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Gender Identity</strong></td><td>Female</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Is Married?</strong></td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Is Gay?<br></strong></td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Net Worth</strong></td><td class=quick-facts-td2>$1.5 Million</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Much information about her childhood is not available in the media because she is an extremely private person who keeps her private life hidden from the public eye. In Brooklyn, she attended Kingsborough Community College.</p><p>She is well-known for her role in the comedy series ‘Impractical Jokers,’ in which her brother Sal Vulcano also appeared.</p><h2>Jenna’s Brother</h2><p>Sal Vulcano, her brother, is a producer, actor, and comedian. He is a member of the comedy troupe ‘The Tenderloins,’ which also includes James Murray, Joe Gatto, and Brian Quinn. They all went to the same high school. He also holds a finance degree from St. Jhon’s University.</p><p>Sal is well-known for his role in the film ‘Impractical Jokers.’ Her brother is constantly posting amusing photos on Instagram. He also has several phobias, including Germaphobia (fear of germs), Acrophobia (fear of heights), and Ailurophobia (fear of cats).</p><p>Sal was even in an accident when he was only four years old. He mentioned it on his show, and as a result of the show’s punishment, he had to get a tattoo of Jaden Smith on his left thigh.</p><h2>In the show, she played pranks on his brother Sal Vulcano</h2><p>His brother and his friends appear to be heartless with their pranks in the show ‘Impractical Jokers.’She appeared in several episodes of that show in 2012. She easily found her place in the show as audiences accepted her character.</p><p>In the show, there was a rule called “Rule of Thump,” and her role put her in a lot of awkward situations. The show’s main goal was to put people in awkward situations, and as a result, Jenna has become Topless.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Jenna_Vulcano_2-1.png><p>This occurred when her brother’s friend James Murray used his sister Jenna Presence to put him in an awkward situation. Jenna Vulcano, James Murray’s sister, was legally married. In the month of March of 2014, her brother (Sal) was blindfolded and led to the church, where he saw his sister (Jenna) walking down the aisle in a wedding gown, and her groom was none other than his friend (James).</p><p>He was taken aback when he saw that. He was shackled and forced to watch the entire thing. The marriage was legal but declared null and void the next day. The entire thing was shown in the third season’s final episode.</p><p>Aside from that, there is no information in the media about her relationships. She does not have any children as of yet. There are rumors that she resumed her life as a reserved individual because she is not on any social media platform. She is said to be working as a Medical Receptionist in New York.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Jenna-Vulcano-age-250x300-1.jpg><h2>Net Worth</h2><p><strong>Jenna Vulcano’s net worth is estimated to be around $100,000 as of August 2023</strong>. Jenna’s primary source of income is from acting and stand-up comedy.</p><p>She has previously worked as a coordinator and is now a medical receptionist. Her brother’s (Sal Vulcan’s) net worth is around $5 million. His income is derived from his acting, producer, and comedian work.</p><h2>Trivia</h2><ul><li>She was born on August 4, 1986.</li><li>She is the eldest of two siblings, with one brother and one sister.</li></ul><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Jenna Vulcano</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Jenna Vulcano net worth</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiuoaddnsButsSnpZplpqq5pK3NqGY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-jenna-vulcano.html&text=Who%20Is%20Jenna%20Vulcano%3f%20Facts%20People%20Dont%20Know%20About%20Her&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-jenna-vulcano.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-jenna-vulcano.html&title=Who%20Is%20Jenna%20Vulcano%3f%20Facts%20People%20Dont%20Know%20About%20Her" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-jenna-vulcano.html&title=Who%20Is%20Jenna%20Vulcano%3f%20Facts%20People%20Dont%20Know%20About%20Her" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-jenna-vulcano.html&title=Who%20Is%20Jenna%20Vulcano%3f%20Facts%20People%20Dont%20Know%20About%20Her" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-jenna-vulcano.html&description=Who%20Is%20Jenna%20Vulcano%3f%20Facts%20People%20Dont%20Know%20About%20Her" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./why-did-steve-perry-leave-journey.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why Did Steve Perry Leave Journey?
