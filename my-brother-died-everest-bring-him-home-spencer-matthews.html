With just a year and a half between them, he and Mike were the closest of friends. The loss was heartbreaking for James.”</p><p>The brothers’ father David has launched a series of legal battles in a bid to get justice for his son, who he believes died because of the negligence of mountain guides.</p><p>And when it comes to getting what he wants, David is not used to losing.</p><p>The son of a Rotherham coal miner, he went from being a car mechanic to building a reputed £40million business empire from selling cars.</p><p>In his younger years he had built a promising career as a racing driver, until he suffered an eye injury in a serious crash at Silverstone that killed another driver and ended his racing days.</p><p>In the 1990s twice-married David went into property development. He and second wife Jane later spent some time living in Paris then they moved to tax haven Monaco.</p><p>Today he owns a hotel in the Caribbean and a 10,000-acre Scottish estate — which entitles him to call himself the Laird of Glen Affric.&nbsp;</p><p>And of course the family have royal connections, with son James married to Pippa — sister of Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge.</p><p>Six years after she had been a bridesmaid for her sister at the global spectacle of a royal wedding, Pippa married James at St Mark’s Church in Englefield, Berks in 2017.</p><p>Their new niece and nephew Princess Charlotte and Prince George both had small roles in the bridal party.</p><p>Spencer attended the day solo, despite being in a relationship with his now wife, Vogue.</p><p>According to reports, a “no ring, no bring” policy was enforced due to the future monarchs William and <a href=#>Kate</a> being there too. Today Pippa is hugely supportive of The Michael Matthews Foundation.</p><p>In 2018 she and James even gave their first-born son Arthur the second name Michael in tribute.</p><p>In 2014 she and her 34-year-old brother James cycled 3,000 miles across the US for the charity and two years later they reached the 14,000ft summit of the Matterhorn in the Swiss Alps to raise money for the foundation.</p><p>Pippa said at the time: “It was humbling to have been able to climb one of the world’s most beautiful mountains and raise money for a charity created in memory of an extraordinary young man who lost his life on another peak.”</p><p>James, himself a millionaire businessman, has also competed in gruelling feats, including iron man challenges and triathlons, to raise cash and awareness.</p><p>Last year Spencer completed the gruelling six-day Marathon Des Sables foot race across Morocco’s Sahara Desert to support the foundation.</p><p>&nbsp;Spencer said about the foundation’s work: “We put 4,000 children through education in Africa who would be unlikely to receive one without the foundation.”</p><p>&nbsp;Explaining how his family have struggled to cope with the circumstances of Michael’s death, Spencer wrote in his autobiography: “We have not been able to say goodbye in person.</p><p>“We have nowhere to go to sit with him.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>“He lives on with us in our minds only. On Mike’s birthday James and I send Mum and Dad red roses for the age he would have been — I guess our family’s way of dealing with losing Mike is to believe that he goes on with us.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s just that he’s in another place.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/NINTCHDBPICT000715818898-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/NINTCHDBPICT000715864341-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/NINTCHDBPICT000638007926-1.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2ispmSBeXyYaW9tZ52ueqO%2Bzq2fnqpdmbamsIyerZ6qlajBbq7RoqWgZZieum60zqacZqugmruksdFmpJqspJ2yuL%2BO</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmy-brother-died-everest-bring-him-home-spencer-matthews.html&text=My%20brother%20Michael%20died%20on%20Everest%2023%20years%20ago...%20I%20want%20to%20go%20there%20and%20bring%20him%20home%2c%20says%20Spenc&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmy-brother-died-everest-bring-him-home-spencer-matthews.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmy-brother-died-everest-bring-him-home-spencer-matthews.html&title=My%20brother%20Michael%20died%20on%20Everest%2023%20years%20ago...%20I%20want%20to%20go%20there%20and%20bring%20him%20home%2c%20says%20Spenc" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmy-brother-died-everest-bring-him-home-spencer-matthews.html&title=My%20brother%20Michael%20died%20on%20Everest%2023%20years%20ago...%20I%20want%20to%20go%20there%20and%20bring%20him%20home%2c%20says%20Spenc" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmy-brother-died-everest-bring-him-home-spencer-matthews.html&title=My%20brother%20Michael%20died%20on%20Everest%2023%20years%20ago...%20I%20want%20to%20go%20there%20and%20bring%20him%20home%2c%20says%20Spenc" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmy-brother-died-everest-bring-him-home-spencer-matthews.html&description=My%20brother%20Michael%20died%20on%20Everest%2023%20years%20ago...%20I%20want%20to%20go%20there%20and%20bring%20him%20home%2c%20says%20Spenc" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./vanderpump-rules-season-5-episode-4-recap-the-thirst-is-strong-w.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="The Thirst is Strong With This One">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./jaime-gomez.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jaime Gomez">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
