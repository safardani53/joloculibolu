Big brands, which have been called out for their problematic leadership and behavior, have apologized for their actions ‚Äî some company execs have even stepped down from their roles. On a smaller (but just as important scale) cookbook author and viral recipe writer <a href=#>Alison Roman recently apologized</a> for <a href=#>a photo that was taken</a> of her a few years back.</p><p>The photo (which was originally tweeted by word class journalist Yashar Ali, who says he found the photo on Alison‚Äôs Myspace) shows Alison wearing large hoop earrings, heavy makeup, a white tank top, and fake tattoos drawn on her chest. Yashar deleted his initial tweet and retweeted it again, this time tweeting his original tweet and Alison‚Äôs response (which we‚Äôll get to in a second) and starting a new thread.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>1. A lot of debate on this tweet of mine to the left. I have deleted it while keeping it here so that it can sit next to <a href=#>@alisoneroman</a>‚Äôs tweet.

We can agree to disagree but I always appreciate the honest feedback and accountability.</p>‚Äî Yashar Ali üêò (@yashar) <a href=#>June 8, 2020</a></figure><p>Alison Roman, who was recently (and fairly) called out for calling out Chrissy Teigen and Marie Kondo for ‚Äúselling out,‚Äù responded to the photo by tweeting, ‚ÄúThis incredibly embarrassing picture was taken in 2008, I was 23 & living in SF, this was my "SF inspired Amy Winehouse" costume for Halloween- it reads as culturally insensitive, and I was an idiot child who knew nothing about the world/how this would be perceived and I'm sorry.‚Äù</p><p>So far, Twitter is divided. Some say that Alison was clearly just dressing up as Amy Winehouse for Halloween&nbsp;and doesn‚Äôt deserve the backlash.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>the mob wants blood but lol it's literally amy winehouse's wikipedia photo - same eye makeup, hair, white tank, black and red bra straps lololol</p><p>people who saw "brownface" are the real racists! <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/8oTNTz87zF</a></p>‚Äî Content Based Restriction Cernovich (@Cernovich) <a href=#>June 8, 2020</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>You did nothing wrong.

You were an adult. Probably a college grad. Stop infantalizing yourself as a way to skirt accountability.</p>‚Äî Ambereen Dadabhoy (@DrDadabhoy) <a href=#>June 8, 2020</a></figure><p>Where it gets even more complicated is this: If Alison seemed to have dressed up as Amy Winehouse (and the Halloween photo of her does seem to show she mimicked Amy‚Äôs style), is it problematic of the people who are calling her out for dressing up as a Latina-identifying woman simply because she‚Äôs wearing hoop earrings, drew on a beauty mark and tattoos, and has bangs? @Cernovich tweeted, ‚Äúpeople who saw 'brownface' are the real racists!‚Äù&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">So...what is Amy Winehouse‚Äôs race exactly?</h2><p>Amy Winehouse is Russian-Jewish-Polish and was born in London. If you had to describe Amy Winehouse‚Äôs style, it would probably be ‚Äúmodern-day pin-up girl‚Äù as she incorporated a lot of ‚Äò50s elements (the beehive hair and Marilyn Monroe‚Äôs beauty mark) with a punk twist. Anyone looking up an ‚ÄúAmy Winehouse‚Äù costume guide probably read articles like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>this</u></a> or <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>this</u></a>. Amy Winehouse was not Latina, if we have to make that clear.</p><p>Alison admitted how much thought process went into the costume. She tweeted, ‚ÄúTBH I'd be surprised if I even looked up a picture of Amy to put this together. I am historically lazy and bad at costumes. I'm sure it went something like 'someone give me fake tattoos and some eyeliner, this seems fine! now plz hand me the Bacardi 151!' It was/I was VERY DUMB.‚Äù</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>TBH I'd be surprised if I even looked up a picture of Amy to put this together.

She seemed to have done so because she realized that, even though her intent was to dress up as Amy Winehouse, some may not have seen it that way, and it‚Äôs vital right now for people with white privilege to take ownership of any pain they‚Äôve caused people of color (even if they didn‚Äôt mean to).&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflrq6edaipZ6gn6rApnnRmpqe</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2famy-winehouse-race.html&text=Alison%20Roman%20Is%20Under%20Attack%20Again%20for%20This%20Halloween%20Photo&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2famy-winehouse-race.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2famy-winehouse-race.html&title=Alison%20Roman%20Is%20Under%20Attack%20Again%20for%20This%20Halloween%20Photo" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2famy-winehouse-race.html&title=Alison%20Roman%20Is%20Under%20Attack%20Again%20for%20This%20Halloween%20Photo" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2famy-winehouse-race.html&title=Alison%20Roman%20Is%20Under%20Attack%20Again%20for%20This%20Halloween%20Photo" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2famy-winehouse-race.html&description=Alison%20Roman%20Is%20Under%20Attack%20Again%20for%20This%20Halloween%20Photo" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./anderson-cooper-shares-family-photo-son-wyatt-second-birthday.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Anderson Cooper Shares New Family Photo for Son Wyatt's 2nd Birthday">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-liz-stewart-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Liz Stewart Dating Now">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
