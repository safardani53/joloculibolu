I coached golfers and then got into the psychological side of it and got my qualifications."</p><p>Dan left golf behind, registered as a sports psychologist in 2006 because he wanted to specialize in lots of sports.</p><p>He began life in football with Wayne Burnett, who is now the under-23s coach at Tottenham.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000392202680-e1521122160963.jpg><p>"I went into non-league and had the pleasure of working with Wayne, who was at Fisher Athletic at the time," Dan said.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Latest football features</h2></p><p>"I had a great time, got to know the language and was proud to say that nine players went up to play league football when the season ended.</p><p>"It then became apparent to me how important the mental side of things is in football."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000392389311.jpg><p>His work with Fisher Athletic got him noticed and he was put in touch with a mutual friend of Carlton Cole, who was struggling at West Ham.</p><p>Dan divulged: "About a decade ago, I got a call from someone who asked if I could work with Carlton Cole.</p><p>"He was languishing in the reserves at the time. We got on well, worked on a few things and 18-months later he won his first cap for England.</p><p>"Carlton was very kind to say publicly, and I'm only a small part of the process, that some of what we did helped him."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000004957521-e1521122458670.jpg><p>Around the same time, <a href=#>when Anthony Stokes was plying his trade in Scotland</a> at Hibernian and struggling for form, Dan was called in again to restore the striker's belief.</p><h3><a href=#><span>MESSI BUSINESS</span> <span>The man who signed Lionel Messi on a napkin: Carles Rexach snapped up Argentina star for Barcelona at a restaurant in 2000</span></a></h3><p>"I worked with Anthony Stokes around that time when he was north of the border," he said.</p><p>"Stokes scored six goals in a month after we started working together.

I've probably worked with individuals of all the 92 clubs."</p><p>He continued: "And it's very varied. You can work in the medical department and support injured players.</p><p>"You can work to support the manager and the coaching staff.

They build that in their mind and create a stress response.</p><p>"They then become very anxious and that can go in one of two directions. They start to force their performance or they become so fearful they freeze.</p><p>"And what happens on the pitch too.</p><p>"Rather than see the 360 viewpoint, tracking runners, being aware of the movement of their teammates, they become tunnel-visioned.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000392389295.jpg><p>"Their anticipation slows down, their decision-making suffers. What that adds up to is just a general decline of performance.</p><p>"Confidence goes down, they lose their first touch, they're scared to take a shot. That has a massive impact."</p><p>So how does he help a player get out of that ruck?</p><p>"For me, as a psychologist, I know I have to immediately start a conversation about their strengths," Dan explained.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000392202972-e1521124884273.jpg><p>"I'll tell the player to tell me about them at their best. Tell me what that looks like, feels like, what's your movement like, what runs they are making...</p><p>"We also use action-based words that encourage them to work to their best.</p><p>"If a player says to me they're sharp and athletic, I'm going to build on those keywords.</p><p>"What I'd encourage that player to do, when he goes out on the pitch, is to concentrate on those words.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000392202682-e1521124970443.jpg><p>"Show me what sharp movement and athletic looks like. I will encourage them to stop trying to force their performance."</p><p>Dan is in admiration of the <a href=#>modern day football managers</a>.</p><p>He insists, though they're not psychologists themselves, they have to have the skills to communicate with their players.</p><p>"Managers do like to get involved," he said. "Football is what we call in the profession a psych-social game.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000392202830-e1521125084836.jpg><p>"Being a manager or coach of a football team is being a manager or coach of people first. It's player second, performance third.</p><p>"Managers have to have great people skills. They have to be a manager of people.</p><p>"They then have to be a manager of a player, then they have to be a manger of performance.</p><p>"People are complex. They bring to the table different needs, wants, hopes, doubts, fears, beliefs, expectations, cultures, backgrounds.</p><p>"They construct their own worlds around them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000202874249-e1521125432898.jpg><p>"A manager absolutely incorporates psychology in his role. He's not a psychologist, per se, but he has to do effective psychology.</p><p>"He's got to be passionate about learning, how human beings learn and how he can help specific players learn.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">most read in football</h2></p><p>"Really, that's where modern day managers have to keep improving."</p><p>Footballers like Aaron Lennon, Clarke Carlisle and Rio Ferdinand have highlighted the pressures they've been under while playing.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000392202818-e1521125604865.jpg><p>Dan thinks the machismo side of football is beginning to change footballers' perspectives in opening up about their issues psychologically.</p><p>"I think more footballers are accepting they have to open up," he said.</p><p>"High-profile footballers have come out and spoken about it, which definitely helps.</p><p>"I believe there's more of an understanding of, 'We're sports people, we're strong, but we're still subject to life events that can alter our way of thinking'.</p><p>"Just because they're physically fit and can pass a ball around well, it doesn't mean they're not immune to the stresses of life.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/nintchdbpict000392202973-e1521125623279.jpg><p>"In the clinical side of things, it's been brilliant that players are discussing their issues much more."</p><p>Dan regularly gives seminars around the UK, telling of his philosophies, and is a published author of several sport psychology books.</p><p>His advice for any prospective talent that's looking to make it in the game is very simple. You have to apply yourself fully.</p><p>"Take responsibility for your learning.
