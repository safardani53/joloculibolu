Ever since he was a kid, he had an excellent aptitude for athletics.</p><p>To top it off, his elder brother, <a href=#>Jason Kelce</a>, is also an American football player and plays as the center for the <a href=#>Philadelphia Eagles</a>.</p><p>Growing up, the two constantly competed against each other, which boosted their growth. Now they are one of the most accomplished siblings in the <a href=#>NFL</a> and will be making history by playing against each other at the Super Bowl LVII.&nbsp;</p><h3>Collegiate Career</h3><p>During his time at Cleveland Heights High School, Travis Kelce was a three-sport athlete: football, baseball, and basketball, but he was more interested in football which is why he decided to continue playing football.&nbsp;</p><p>The athlete accepted the scholarship offer from the University of Cincinnati in 2008, despite having offers from Miami (OH), Akron, and Eastern Michigan.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Travis-Kelce-and-Jason-Kelce.jpg><p>Travis was then considered a 2-star recruit and redshirted in 2008.

I DMed Him. The End.”</p><p>While the internet was all up for the lovely couple, Maya Benberry, Travis’s ex-girlfriend, was not pleased, which is not much of a surprise.&nbsp;</p><p>Before dating Kayla, Travis starred in a show, “Catching Kelce,” in 2016, where women competed to get his heart.</p><p>Beating several women, Maya Benberry won the show and Kelce as the prize; however, the couple broke up soon after in January 2017.&nbsp;</p><p>When Maya found out about the new couple, she tweeted accusing Travis of cheating, stating that they broke up five months ago, but the social media had claimed that he had been in a relationship with Kayla for six months.&nbsp;</p><p>These claims were unheard of and forgotten as the public couldn’t stop gushing about Kayla and Travis.</p><h2>Breakup & Patch-up</h2><p>In August 2020, the news about the breakup between Travis Kelce and Kayla Nicole broke out. After being together for three years, fans and followers were perplexed by the sudden and unexplained breakup.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, Kayla deleted all the pictures of her and the NFL star together off her social media as if to erase all the evidence of her relationship with Travis.&nbsp;</p><p>Various rumors of the athlete cheating on Kayla surged up, but Kelce denied the claims and clarified that it was fake news, a lie, and not the reason for their separation.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Travis-Kelce-and-his-girlfriend-Kayla-Nicole-3.jpg><p>Gladly, in November 2020, the model was seen in the games Kelce played, and later the footballer revealed that they were back together.</p><p>The couple broke up again, according to a video published on YouTube on May 26, 2022. The video says the couple broke up because Travis made her pay for everything they did during their relationship.</p><p>In January 2023, on ‘The Pivot’ podcast, Travis said, “I’m in the free market right now,” proving his break up with Kayla.</p><p>He further added, “I’m out there just enjoying life, focused on my profession.

Her earnings from her multiple professions must add quite a sum to her assets.&nbsp;</p><p>She asked how Instagram influencers can afford designer clothes and nice jewelry in her Instagram story and mentioned about taking care of her finances independently.&nbsp;</p><p>But things didn’t turn up well; people began criticizing and harassing Travis Kelce on the internet about how, even though he had signed a $57 million contract, he didn’t spoil her or help her financially.&nbsp;</p><p>Kayla clapped back, saying she was happy with her man and the $50 outfit from Zara, but this further ignited the topic.
