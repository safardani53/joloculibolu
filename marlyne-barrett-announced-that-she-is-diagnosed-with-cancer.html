Barrett married her husband, Gavin Barrett, on May 15, 2009, and the pair later became parents to twins Joshuah-Jireh and Ahnne-N’Urya, who are 11 years old.&nbsp;Barrett recently said that her husband Gavin has been a huge support for her during her cancer experience. In relation to this, she stated:</p><p>“I’m married to the most amazing guy. He’ll drop everything to offer me meals and hand massages when I have pins and sensations in my limbs from the chemo. He’s dropped everything to be with me.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Marlyne-Barrett-2.jpg alt="Marlyne Barrett" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>More information about Marlyne Barrett’s cancer journey</h2><p>Marlyne Barrett became ill following hernia surgery in April 2022, claiming that she had a buildup of fluid in her belly that she couldn’t get rid of, giving her the appearance of being nine months pregnant. She also said that she was having problems breathing.&nbsp;Doctors discovered a large tumor in her ovary and uterus in July of this year, which “shocked” her since her family has no history of uterine or ovarian cancer.</p><p>Barrett declared:</p><p>“I didn’t believe them at first, but when they showed me the CT image, I said, ‘Oh, my word.'” ‘Am I going to live?’ was one of the first inquiries. I just collapsed into my husband’s arms. When I think about it, it still takes my breath away.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Marlyne-Barrett-1.jpg alt="Marlyne Barrett" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Doctors advised her to get chemotherapy followed by a hysterectomy. They also informed her that she would lose her hair, to which Barrett responded that, despite the fact that “her hair has been an essential of her beauty,” she “took a razor and shaved her head in front of her kids.”&nbsp;Marlyne Barrett has been working for Chicago Med despite certain health concerns, noting that she takes periodic naps and days off to keep her energy levels in control, adding:</p><p>“Because of the size of the cast, my mid-range is a different size, therefore the costume designer performs an amazing job.” Surprisingly, my character in the program already wears a wig! Work is now bringing me a lot of delight. It gives me a lot of relief to be able to focus on anything other than “When is my next chemo shift?” and “How am I going to embrace my children?”</p><p>She is prepared for her third round of chemotherapy in Los Angeles, taking things “one day at a time.”</p><p></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Actress</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Marlyne Barrett</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGikmqqcrrumecGaqaudpKl6orrNqKynm5WZerW0wK1krKCVYra0ecOimKCmn6iypXnWoquhZZOWu6Sx0Wg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmarlyne-barrett-announced-that-she-is-diagnosed-with-cancer.html&text=Marlyne%20Barrett%20Announced%20That%20She%20Is%20Diagnosed%20With%20Cancer&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmarlyne-barrett-announced-that-she-is-diagnosed-with-cancer.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmarlyne-barrett-announced-that-she-is-diagnosed-with-cancer.html&title=Marlyne%20Barrett%20Announced%20That%20She%20Is%20Diagnosed%20With%20Cancer" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmarlyne-barrett-announced-that-she-is-diagnosed-with-cancer.html&title=Marlyne%20Barrett%20Announced%20That%20She%20Is%20Diagnosed%20With%20Cancer" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmarlyne-barrett-announced-that-she-is-diagnosed-with-cancer.html&title=Marlyne%20Barrett%20Announced%20That%20She%20Is%20Diagnosed%20With%20Cancer" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmarlyne-barrett-announced-that-she-is-diagnosed-with-cancer.html&description=Marlyne%20Barrett%20Announced%20That%20She%20Is%20Diagnosed%20With%20Cancer" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./mean-girls-halloween-costume-diy-4867932.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mean Girls Halloween Costume DIY  Hollywood Life">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ruben-gallego.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fame | Ruben Gallego net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
