Whether it‚Äôs the Catfish host scrambling to stop a physical fight, or Nev throwing a culprit‚Äôs phone into a river ‚Äì we‚Äôve seen it all.</strong></p><p>Following the success of Nev‚Äôs story in the film ‚Äò<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Catfish</a>‚Äò, which is based on his own experience of trying to meet up with a love online, MTV carved out a new type of reality show that followed the difficulty of dating in the online world. Nev Schulman has been following and chasing stories of people falling in love online before they meet in person ever since.</p><p>The show aired its first episode in 2012 and has released a total of 210 across eight different seasons. Max Joseph, who had been with Nev Schulman since the very beginning, left the show for good in 2018. However, Kamie Crawford took over his position and has been accompanying Nev ever since.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><p>Throughout its years on air, Nev has witnessed many stories. Even though some have had happy endings, some ended with a lot of drama with fights in between.</p><p>Let‚Äôs take a look at Catfish‚Äôs most shocking and dramatic moments.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-mtv-catfish-s-biggest-dramatic-events-fighting-to-nev-throwing-phone-into-river>MTV Catfish‚Äôs biggest dramatic events ‚Äì Fighting to Nev throwing phone into river</h2><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-5-nev-threw-catfish-s-phone-into-the-river>5.

This time, Nev wasn‚Äôt the calm and collected one during the first meet with the Catfish pretending to be ‚ÄòKidd Cole‚Äô.</p><p>Lucille and ‚ÄòKidd‚Äô met online after she had discovered his music on SoundCloud. As the two began to get to know each other, ‚ÄòKidd‚Äô pretended to be a music producer for Kanye West‚Äôs label.</p><p>‚ÄòKidd‚Äô managed to get money from Lucille and disappear. That left her penniless, but he got caught thanks to the help of Nev and Max. After revealing himself, he discovered his true identity.</p><p>Nev couldn‚Äôt contain his frustration with ‚ÄòKidd‚Äô and ended up throwing the scammer‚Äôs iPhone into the Potomac River.

He had recently broken up with his boyfriend of six years, Antonnio.</p><p>Though he had gone through a rough patch getting over him, Alfred found comfort with a military serviceman named Adonis. However, Adonis had no social media accounts and only had a Messenger account. Though they never met in person or had a video chat, Alfred was able to open up to Adonis.</p><p>Nev and Kamie discovered that Adonis‚Äô identity was fake. This led to the duo investigating more about the fake account. At one point in the episode, we then see his ex Antonnio showing up and shouting at Alfred for his past infidelities.</p><p>As the tension was increasing, Antonnio dropped the major bombshell, saying: ‚ÄúThe reason why you can‚Äôt find a person is because I‚Äôm Adonis, b****‚Äù. This led to the two getting physical until <a href=# rel=nofollow>Nev rushes over to separate them.</a></p><p>Antonnio and Alfred ended up reconciling and expressing their feelings over what happened, and later became ‚Äúfriends again‚Äù.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-3-nev-s-very-own-catfish-started-it-all>3.

Nonetheless, despite his heartbreak, his story became a hit and the idea was turned into a TV show.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Page Six</a>, Nev fell in love with a girl named Megan on Facebook. Megan was the sister of a young girl who liked his photograph in a magazine, and would send him paintings she did of his work. They struck up a small friendship where Nev would receive her art work and speak to her family, including her mom and ‚Äòsister‚Äô.</p><p>His brother and friend documented his story in the 2010 film, Catfish. What began as filming small bits about this long-distance friendship soon turned into following Nev on his journey of falling for someone (Megan, the older sister), online. This included finding out that Megan probably didn‚Äôt exist.</p><p>‚ÄúA lot of people haven‚Äôt seen that or don‚Äôt even realize that the reason I‚Äôm hosting the show is because I myself got catfished in sort of very epic way back in 2008,‚Äù Nev previously explained.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=uncovering-the-clues>Uncovering the clues</h2><p>The first clue came when the now 38-year-old would receive MP3 recordings of Megan singing songs exclusively for him. However, he then finds out that they were clips from YouTube, and a song by someone else.</p><p>Determined to get to the bottom of it, his brother convinces him to carry out their relationship until they finally get to meet the person behind it all. Nev then finds out that he had been speaking with <a href=# rel=nofollow>Angela Wesselman</a>, who had been using pictures of a professional model to fake her identity.</p><p>Angela did have daughters Abby and Megan, but they weren‚Äôt who she pretended they were, including Abby not painting any of the original pictures herself at all ‚Äì Angela was the artist, and she had developed feelings for Nev.</p><p>Although the two, after meeting, spoke about what happened, went their separate ways.

While, Nev later came out and said he felt ‚Äúpowerless‚Äù while the investigation was underway.</p><p>He said: ‚ÄúTo be accused of something that I squarely did not do and to have the harsh judgment that followed and no way to counteract or do something in the moment to correct that was very difficult.</p><p>‚ÄúIt was frustrating.
