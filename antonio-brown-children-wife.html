His career in the NFL is well-celebrated and appreciated.&nbsp;</p><p>However, his professional life is often overshadowed by his personal one. He has four sons and two daughters —&nbsp;Antonio Brown Jr, Antanyiah Brown, Autonomy Brown, Ali Brown, Apollo Brown, and Allure Brown.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>AB and his ex-girlfriend, Shameika Brailsford, welcomed their first child, a boy called Antonio, in 2007. In March 2008, his daughter Antanyiah Brown, whom he had with ex-girlfriend Wiltrice Jackson, was born.&nbsp;</p><p>AB began dating Chelsie Kyriss in 2012. They welcomed four children together, including Autonomy, Ali, Apollo, and his most recent daughter, Allure, who was born in July 2020.</p><p>To date, AB has never had a wife and has not been married. However, his life with two of his baby mama is full of drama.</p><p>Here is all we know about it.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Antonio Brown and Chelsie Kyriss</h2><p>Kyriss was born in Springboro, Ohio, on September 1, 1989. She attended Sinclair Community College and Georgia State University Perimeter College after graduating from Springboro High School.</p><p>According to her <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a> profile, she has been working as a customer service representative for Wilton Brands Inc. since January 2012 until the present. However, it is unknown when or if she has left the job.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>She previously worked as an assistant instructor at Adventure Through Learning and as a shoe store assistant manager.</p><p>She also claims to be a designer and a real estate agent on her mostly inactive Instagram account. She has a total of six children —&nbsp;four of whom are with AB, Autonomy, Ali, Apollo, and Allure, and two elder kids from a previous relationship, Kellen and Brooklyn.</p><p>AB and Kyriss <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">met</a> in 2012 and have since made headlines ever since. However, the news has rarely been a pleasant one since their entire relationship was like a roller coaster.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>In December 2019, AB attempted to evict his children’s mother from his Florida house using court documents in which he demanded a default judgment. A few weeks later, he contacted the cops on her, accusing her of stealing a Bentley from his house and live-streaming the confrontation on social media.&nbsp;</p><p>In turn, she filed a lawsuit demanding primary custody of their children as well as child support. Kyriss earlier filed a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">paternity</a> suit in 2017, alleging that he fostered a hostile environment.&nbsp;</p><p>Although the case was abandoned, he later retaliated by labeling her an “unfit mother.” In January 2020, the designer resorted to social media to urge her ex to get mental health therapy for the sake of his children.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/glamourbuff.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/AB.jpeg><p class="has-text-align-center has-small-font-size">Antonio Brown and his almost wife, Chelsie Kyriss. (Source: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Instagram</a>)</p><p>She claimed she was separating herself from him and his house, as well as wishing him the best. Less than a month later, the NFL player issued a lengthy apology, thanking God for allowing him to examine himself thoroughly on Instagram, which has since been deleted.</p><p>He then went on to offer the “world’s biggest apology” to Kyriss and their three children. AB was then seen in the back of a limo with Kyriss and their kids in Paris, France.&nbsp;</p><p>He expressed regret for his public outbursts and the pain he caused while on his “emotional rollercoaster.” After that, it looked like the couple were going strong and mending their relationship.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>It also looked like AB was ready to make Kyriss his wife. He announced their engagement in March 2020, and she gave <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">birth</a> to their fourth child on July 23, 2020.</p><p>However, it looks like AB and Kyriss never got to call each other husband and wife and, instead, decided to part ways. They appear to have broken up again in 2022 since he was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">supposedly</a> dating Keyshia Cole, who appeared on his breakthrough song ‘Don’t Leave,’ in mid-2022.</p><p>Cole exposed him after an unpleasant social media feud for callously remarking, “Baby, I liked you at first, but now I don’t—it’s a no.” Since mid-2022, Kyriss has not been active on social media.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Antonio Brown and Wiltrice Jackson</h2><p>As said before, AB welcomed his daughter Antanyiah with his ex-girlfriend, Jackson, in March 2008.</p><p>On October 17, 2023, according to the Broward County Sheriff’s Department, a former NFL wide receiver was arrested in Florida on a warrant for unpaid child support payments.</p><p>According to court papers, the warrant was issued the previous week. It claims AB violated a child support arrangement he had with Jackson, the mother of his eldest daughter.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>According to authorities, AB was released after posting a $15,000 bail. According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TMZ</a>, Jackson claimed AB owes more than $30,000 in child support.</p><p>“I do want him arrested,” Jackson told TMZ. “Because, right now, he’s making a mockery out of the judge, out of everything, because he feels like he’s untouchable.”</p><p>She also wants the former NFL athlete to be more engaged in the life of their 15-year-old daughter as she begins to get track-and-field scholarship offers from big universities in the USA.</p><p>Jackson noted that Antanyiah had received interest from over 80 schools, including the University of Oregon and the University of Miami.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>Jackson noted that despite their daughter being an excellent athlete, AB was not interested in her. “By him having a daughter like an athlete like her, you would think he’d be in her corner to support her,” she commented.</p><p>She also pointed out that AB had pushed her to her limit when it came to child support and their daughter. As a result, she had no plans to stop fighting for her daughter and her future.</p><p>At the time of writing, AB has made no comments regarding his arrest, Jackson, Antanyiah, or child support.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6yfnl6YvK570qmmq6yjZK6vwM6noKhlkqe8uLqMnJ%2BipJSnsq951qKdnmc%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fantonio-brown-children-wife.html&text=Antonio%20Brown%20Has%20Six%20Children%20But%20Does%20Not%20Have%20Any%20Wife&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fantonio-brown-children-wife.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fantonio-brown-children-wife.html&title=Antonio%20Brown%20Has%20Six%20Children%20But%20Does%20Not%20Have%20Any%20Wife" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fantonio-brown-children-wife.html&title=Antonio%20Brown%20Has%20Six%20Children%20But%20Does%20Not%20Have%20Any%20Wife" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fantonio-brown-children-wife.html&title=Antonio%20Brown%20Has%20Six%20Children%20But%20Does%20Not%20Have%20Any%20Wife" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fantonio-brown-children-wife.html&description=Antonio%20Brown%20Has%20Six%20Children%20But%20Does%20Not%20Have%20Any%20Wife" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./brielle-biermann-models-kab-cosmetics-instagram-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Brielle Biermann Poses for KAB Cosmetics Photo Shoot in Lingerie-Clad Instagram Pics">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./cindy-williams-husband-5018553.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="All About The Late Stars Ex, Bill Hudson  Hollywood Life">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
