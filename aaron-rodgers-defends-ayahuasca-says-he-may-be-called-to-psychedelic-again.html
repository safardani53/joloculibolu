They feigned taking sips, then had intense, ayahuasca-like reactions from trembling to falling to the ground.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Eagle-eyed fans identified the connection between the celebratory moment and their quarterback's off-season preference for doing ayahuasca.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The former Super Bowl champion addressed the celebration on the web-based sports talk show afterward, saying he and Lazard had talked about doing a specific, memorable celebration with the team and once he saw what they were up to ran over because he "just wanted to get involved."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">However, Rodgers also said he wanted to be sure he wasn't "sending the wrong message" about ayahuasca.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"You're not standing up drinking, having this Jesus revival, slaying in the spirit. It's not like that," he clarified. "You don't have some immediate pass out into oblivion."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When McAfee referred to the substance as a drug, Rodgers stopped him, saying he found the word "manipulative." He said calling it a drug added to biases.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Ayahuasca is not a drug," Rodgers said. "It has properties in it that have hallucinogenic abilities. But it's not a drug. We're talking about plants here.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's a very important point to make," he continued. "This is how words are created in society to create a certain bias against certain things. I do think it's important to go on this ridiculous tangent how words are used to create bias. Those biases create fears and those fears prevent people from doing their own research or having their own idea and truth in a situation."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He said if he is "called" to take ayahuasca again, he would.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I don't think that was the last time," Rodgers said.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Packers' four-time MVP quarterback later said it is "an intuitive feeling" for someone to know when it's time to "sit with the medicine again."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Once you sat with the medicine one time you kind of know what that feeling is that more lessons to be learned. ... Some people sit 100 straight days and still feel called years and years down the road to keep on doing it. I had such a beautiful experience I'm pretty certain it won't be my last."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Rodgers</a> has opened up in the past about how his use of psychedelic drugs helped his personal mental health journey.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">During an interview on the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Aubrey Marcus Podcast</a>, Rodgers said ayahuasca helped him "unconditionally love" others.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"To me, one of the core tenets of your mental health is that self-love," Rodgers told host Aubrey Marcus, who also founded the supplement company, Onnit. "That's what ayahuasca did for me, was help me see how to unconditionally love myself."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"It's only in that unconditional self-love, that then I'm able to truly be able to unconditionally love others," he added. "And what better way to work on my mental health than to have an experience like that?"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He said the effect of the drug also helped his relationship with the Packers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The greatest gift I can give my teammates, in my opinion, is to be able to show up and to be someone who can model unconditional love to them," he explained. "I mean obviously it's important I play well, and show up and lead and all that stuff. They won't care about what you say until they know how much you care."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Aaron Rodgers discusses thoughts on retirement.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Patrick McDermott/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for </strong><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow><strong>PEOPLE's free daily newsletter</strong></a><strong> to stay up to date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Alcohol and Drug Foundation</a>, ayahuasca is drunk as a liquid and can affect a person's thinking, sense of time, and emotions. Ayahuasca contains the active ingredient <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>N,N-Dimethyltryptamine</a> (DMT), which is a banned Schedule I drug, according to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>Double Blind</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Rodgers said he didn't recommend ayahuasca to others, he said it had a profound impact on his life. The substance has been used for centuries, for religious and medicinal purposes in South American countries like Peru — where Rodgers said he first tried ayahuasca in 2020.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In February, Rodgers was named the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Most Valuable Player</a> for the 2021-2022 NFL Season. It was the second time in two seasons that he won the honor.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Rodgers was also a point of controversy after he revealed <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>he did not receive a COVID-19 vaccination</a> after previously telling reporters he was "immunized."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">After his admission, Rodgers was <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>fined</a> for violating the league's COVID protocols, including not wearing a mask during his news conferences and going maskless in the team's facility.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6OlvLPA0miYmqqfo3qzu8OgnKurXZmyp7HNnapmmamWtbat0pyYZquRrsButMRmpJqxXZeybq%2FApaOenF2pvG680rKaoZ2Umrmqr4yanpqhnmQ%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2faaron-rodgers-defends-ayahuasca-says-he-may-be-called-to-psychedelic-again.html&text=Aaron%20Rodgers%27%20Ayahuasca%20Journey%20Isn%27t%20Over%2c%20He%20Says&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2faaron-rodgers-defends-ayahuasca-says-he-may-be-called-to-psychedelic-again.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2faaron-rodgers-defends-ayahuasca-says-he-may-be-called-to-psychedelic-again.html&title=Aaron%20Rodgers%27%20Ayahuasca%20Journey%20Isn%27t%20Over%2c%20He%20Says" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2faaron-rodgers-defends-ayahuasca-says-he-may-be-called-to-psychedelic-again.html&title=Aaron%20Rodgers%27%20Ayahuasca%20Journey%20Isn%27t%20Over%2c%20He%20Says" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2faaron-rodgers-defends-ayahuasca-says-he-may-be-called-to-psychedelic-again.html&title=Aaron%20Rodgers%27%20Ayahuasca%20Journey%20Isn%27t%20Over%2c%20He%20Says" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2faaron-rodgers-defends-ayahuasca-says-he-may-be-called-to-psychedelic-again.html&description=Aaron%20Rodgers%27%20Ayahuasca%20Journey%20Isn%27t%20Over%2c%20He%20Says" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./alejandra-robles-gil.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alejandra Robles Gil">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./ufc-daniel-cormier-brock-lesnar-dana-white.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="UFC champion Daniel Cormier 'should' fight WWE Universal Title holder Brock Lesnar next, says UFC pr">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
