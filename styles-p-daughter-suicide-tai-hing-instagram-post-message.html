Styles opened up about this heart-wrenching event in a July 26 <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram post</a>. Styles said he “rarely speak(s) on [his] personal issues,” but the pain over the loss of Tai was too much for him to hold back. Styles told his fans that in June, “my wife and I lost a daughter and my son lost a sister. My baby girl took her life and there are no words to describe the day-to-day pain we have to endure…”</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>Styles’ absence was noted when his band mates, <strong>Sheek Louch</strong> and <strong>Jadakiss</strong> appeared with the rest of the Bad Boy family at the June 28 event, reports <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Root</a>. Tai <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>reportedly</a> committed suicide on June 25, though Styles didn’t confirm it in his statement. A candlelight vigil for Tai will be held on July 30 at the White Plains High School, according to her <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>mother’s Instagram</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Our support goes out to Styles and his family. No parent should lose a child, especially for suicide. Styles, sadly, is no stranger to loss, as he told his fans that he lost his “brother, father, aunt, grandmother-in-law and too many good friends/brothers and now my daughter!”</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>With all this sadness, Styles made sure to take a moment to tell his fans to appreciate every moment they have with their family. Styles said that the love of “chasing the dollar bill…is not! – I repeat not! – more valuable than the love you get from your family and friends.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>“They print money and make material sh*t everyday, but once you [lose] a love one, that’s it. The spirit is with you but you will miss the physical…,” Styles wrote. It seems that the “I Know” rapper wanted to use this personal tragedy as a way to inspire his fans to truly appreciate their family and friends while they can.&nbsp;Styles ended his sad note as positive as a father could be after the death of a daughter. “I just wanted to tell y’all – keep it family 1st and don’t get lost and lose your focus. The [family] is way more important than anything else. We lost a daughter but gained an angel.”</p><a href=# rel=nofollow readability=1><p>View this post on Instagram</p></a><p><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>I rarely speak on my personal issues and i usually express my pain the through music but today I will share a little with you last month my wife and I lost a daughter and my son lost a sister . My baby girl took her life and there are no words to describe the day to day pain we have to endure and maintain through but in dealing with pain you find yourself dealing with the creator and asking questions and going through emotions most would not understand. So I'm taking this time out to express a few things to y'all because life is short and we are not promised tomorrow. I like to deal with simple math I know I am 180- 180+ but im trying my best to live on the positive side of things . I have truly tried to live up to the code of being a gentleman and gangster to fullest of my ability. I have been chasing the dollar bill since I was 12 years old I hustled I worked legal jobs and even manage to make my dream of making it as a rapper come true I have popped bottles before it was the thing to do , I have owned beamers, benzos , rovers, trucks etc etc etc I have lived in the ritz ,owned condos , houses traveled a lot of places etc etc etc but I can honestly tell you don't none of that shit add up or equal to love!! I have lost my brother , father , aunt , grandmother in law and too many good friends/ brothers and now my daughter!!!! But the only thing that can be done is to leave it in the creators hands . But I wouldn't be me if I didn't take this time out to say from the most humbled part of my heart and soul to say to yall that the dream most of us chase is not !!I repeat is not !!more valuable than the love you get from your family and friends it may seem like it is but it ain't they print money and make material shit everyday but once you used a love one that's it the spirit is with you but you will miss the physical and Won't be able to speak to them how you want to until you get home to the other side. So I just want to tell yall keep it family 1st and don't get lost and lose your focus the fam is way more important than anything else …. We lost a daughter but gained an angel . Love is love ..ghost</a></p><p>A post shared by <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Mrdavidstyles.com</a> (@stylesp) on Jul 26, 2015 at 3:11pm PDT</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>Our thoughts and sympathies go out to Styles P and his family over their devastating loss.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9><strong>—&nbsp;Jason Brow</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWllZH14e5FxZqysqaGytHnPZpuarZedwaa%2BjKysopuZmbJuwMCiZKGhnpx6qrrSrZigqpGierG70q1kpp2jqK6osY4%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fstyles-p-daughter-suicide-tai-hing-instagram-post-message.html&text=Daughters%20Suicide%20Revealed%20In%20Emotional%20Instagram%20Message%20%20Hollywood%20Life&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fstyles-p-daughter-suicide-tai-hing-instagram-post-message.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fstyles-p-daughter-suicide-tai-hing-instagram-post-message.html&title=Daughters%20Suicide%20Revealed%20In%20Emotional%20Instagram%20Message%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fstyles-p-daughter-suicide-tai-hing-instagram-post-message.html&title=Daughters%20Suicide%20Revealed%20In%20Emotional%20Instagram%20Message%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fstyles-p-daughter-suicide-tai-hing-instagram-post-message.html&title=Daughters%20Suicide%20Revealed%20In%20Emotional%20Instagram%20Message%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fstyles-p-daughter-suicide-tai-hing-instagram-post-message.html&description=Daughters%20Suicide%20Revealed%20In%20Emotional%20Instagram%20Message%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./suzana-jovanovic.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fame | Suzana Jovanovi net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./cree-summers-boyfriend-list.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Cree Summers Boyfriend: Who is Cree Summer Dating?">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
