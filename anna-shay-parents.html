At another: "I don't feel this need to compete. I find it fiercely annoying.")</p><p>So, who exactly was this aspirational diva? And who were Anna Shay's parents?

Anna had four joyous marriages and four delightful divorces, as she tells it on the series.</p><p>Her son, who we met at the bowling alley where Anna traveled to join her gaggle of younger friends, turned out to have quite a successful enterprise of his own: collecting five-figure glass bongs and rigs.</p><p>As the "sole heir to hundreds of millions of dollars," Kenny built his own glass empire. "When you're hanging out in his mother's basement," a 2015 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Buzzfeed</a> profile reads, "you can smoke out of a black Glock, a bear shaped like a honey container, or a monkey in a suit smoking a cigarette and holding a banana like a gun."</p><p>And where exactly do these hundreds of millions of dollars that he will be inheriting come from, you might ask?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Well, Anna Shay's parents, Edward Shay and Ai-San Shay, made an absolute fortune from their businesses in exports.</p><p>Edward, who hailed from the South Side of Chicago, founded Pacific Architects and Engineers back in 1955, a private defense company whose clients include countries like the U.K. and the U.S.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Anna's mother, Ai-San, who was Japanese and Russian, passed away in 2015, 20 years after Edward. She came from a family who exported pearls and silk flowers. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reality Titbit</a>, the late couple bonded over the fact that they worked in exports and met during World War II.</p><p>"My mother said, 'You were born in a crystal ball with a silver spoon,'" Anna told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Oprah Magazine</a>. She shared an anecdote from her childhood, back when she had a pet monkey and was afraid her pet wouldn't be allowed to ride in the airplane with her.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"She had a bottom seat in Pan Am but I wanted her to sit next to me," she revealed. "My dad said, 'Walk in and know who you are, where you come from.' My parents would always say that throughout my life."</p><p>Anna's pet monkey was able to sit by her side.</p><p>In 2006, the socialite and her brother sold their father's company for a whopping $1.2 billion. Assuming she and her brother went half and half on the split, the legendary Anna was worth upwards of $600 million at the time.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Anna died in 2023 from a stroke.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>At age 62, Anna Shay unexpectedly passed away from a stroke.
