And, of course, she is on one of the hottest reality shows in the world: Hulu’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Kardashians</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>Ever since Kylie came into her own on&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Keeping Up With The Kardashians</a>, the young starlet has captivated audiences. Not only has she grown up right in front of fans’ eyes, but she’s also dated in the limelight. Now, we’re taking a walk down memory lane with a look back at Kylie’s dating history.</p><h2>Cody Simpson</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kylie-jenner-romantic-timeline-cody-simpson-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Cody</strong> <strong>Simpson</strong></a> was Kylie’s first brush with her personal life going very public outside of&nbsp;KUWTK. The two, who were both 14 years old at the time, seemingly started dating after officially meeting at the premiere of Breaking Dawn: Part 1 in Nov. 2011. Cody and Kylie had a cute, flirty moment when the future Kylie Cosmetics founder interviewed him at the premiere, calling the singer her “<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>rumor boyfriend on Twitter</a>.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>While rumors circulated that the two were an item,&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Us Weekly</a> confirmed that the two were dating. “They are a couple,” a source shared with the outlet at the time. “They are so cute together.” The innocent romance, however, quietly fizzled out after a few months. Cody went on to date model <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Gigi Hadid</strong></a> and singer&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Miley Cyrus</strong></a>.</p><h2>Jaden Smith</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kylie-jenner-romantic-timeline-jaden-smith-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>Kylie has always enjoyed a strong friendship with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Jaden Smith</strong></a>. Many may forget that they actually dated in 2013, as the young love was kept completely on the DL when they were together. In 2013, the entrepreneur even called Jaden<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> her “best friend”</a> when wishing him a happy birthday. Kylie also took Jaden as her date to big sister<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> <strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a>‘s&nbsp;wedding to&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kanye West</strong> </a>in 2014, where they were spotted “making out,” according to <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>E! News</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>It’s not clear why they broke up, but the two have remained friends and were even spotted in a group photo (seen <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>here</a>) at &nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Justin Bieber</a></strong>‘s 2018 <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>wedding</a> to&nbsp;<strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Hailey Bieber</a></strong>. Jaden was seen at Kylie’s sister,<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> <strong>Kendall Jenner</strong></a>‘s, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>25th birthday bash</a>.</p><h2>Lil’ Twist</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kylie-jenner-romantic-timeline-lil-twist-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>Kylie and <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Lil Twist</strong> </a>had a rumored romance in 2013 after things went from flirty to friendly with Kylie and Jaden. While this potential romance wasn’t as widely known, it appears that the two went on just a few dates in 2013. Even after things seemingly fizzled out, Kylie and Lil Twist kept things <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>flirty on Twitter</a>. But their relationship never amounted to anything serious.</p><h2>Tyga</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kylie-jenner-romantic-timeline-tyga-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-9>Kylie’s first major high-profile relationship came during her romance with Tyga. The rapper and mogul met at Kylie’s sweet sixteen. It wasn’t until years later when Kylie and Tyga officially started dating in August 2015 — around the time of Kylie’s 18th birthday. The two had an on-again, off-again relationship for <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>roughly two years</a> before officially calling it quits in April 2017. Although rumors swirled about <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>potential reunions between the two</a> — especially after<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Kylie was posted visiting Tyga’s recording studio</a> when she was on a break with Travis — any inkling of a romantic connection they had left did not develop into anything.</p><p id=content-paragraph-10>In fact, following a report that the two met up at a recording studio, Kylie took to Twitter to <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>shut down any further speculation</a>. “The internet makes everything 100 times more dramatic than what it really is. There was no ‘2 am date with Tyga’. You see me drop two of my friends off at a studio that he happened to be at,” she <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>tweeted</a> on October 3, 2019.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>The internet makes everything 100 times more dramatic than what it really is.

He and I will always, always have a bond,” she said on her reality show, Life of Kylie.</p><h2>Travis Scott</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kylie-jenner-romantic-timeline-travis-scott-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-14>April 2017 is when Kylie and&nbsp;Travis Scott’s love story began. The two were spotted at Coachella at the time and things quickly heated up between the two. Less than one year after the couple’s romance started, Kylie and Travis <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>became parents</a> to their first child, <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Stormi Webster</strong></a>, on Feb. 1, 2018. Throughout their two-year romance, the couple waded through rumors about a potential engagement, and in Jan. 2019, Travis seemingly alluded to a possible proposal!</p><p id=content-paragraph-15>“It got to a point where I was like, ‘I need [Kylie] with me to operate. She’s that one,’” he shared with <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Rolling Stone</a>. “We’ll get married soon. I just gotta sturdy up — I gotta propose in a fire way.” Months after his profile with the outlet, those romantic plans came to a shocking halt when <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Kylie and Travis broke up</a> at the end of September 2019.</p><p id=content-paragraph-16>But following their split, fans often wondered if the two would <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>get back together</a>. Rumors about <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a potential romance</a> between Kylie and rapper&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Drake</strong></a> were even thwarted due to the mogul’s very close relationship with Travis. A source close to Kylie and Travis revealed EXCLUSIVELY to <strong>HollywoodLife&nbsp;</strong>that the former couple was trying to keep their relationship status “under wraps.” The pair quietly rekindled their relationship, and they welcomed their second child in Feb. 2022. After initially naming him <strong>Wolf Webster</strong>, Kylie <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>changed it less than two months later</a>. She <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>revealed her son’s new name</a> is <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Aire</strong> </a>in Jan. 2023.</p><p id=content-paragraph-17>As of Jan. 2023, it was reported that the couple separated once again. “Kylie and Travis are off again, they were supposed to spend the holidays together, but she went to Aspen to be with her family and friends up there,”&nbsp; a source told <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Us Weekly</a>. “This has happened so many times before, they’re known to be on again off again, but always remain friends and great coparents.”</p><h2>Timothee Chalamet</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/kylie-jenner-and-timothee-chalamet-spotted-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-18>Kylie and the&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Dune&nbsp;star</a> were linked at the beginning of April 2023 after a<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>&nbsp;video</a> began circulating of them speaking a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Paris Fashion Week 2023</a>. It was reported that Kylie’s car was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>spotted at Timothee’s Beverly Hills mansion</a> and that they <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>enjoyed a taco date</a> after Kylie sent her driver to pick the actor up from an art show in Santa Monica.</p><p id=content-paragraph-19>Then, a person close to the new couple confirmed that they are in fact an item, but aren’t putting pressure on themselves. “They are&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>keeping things casual</a> at this point. It’s not serious, but Kylie is enjoying hanging out with Timothée and seeing where it goes,” the individual told &nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Entertainment Tonight</a>. “It’s been really fun for her because it feels a lot different than her past relationships. It’s new and exciting for Kylie and she’s having a lot of fun.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-20>In July 2023, as Timothee and Kylie’s romance continued to heat up, Travis dropped his fifth studio album, Utopia. Fans immediately noticed that a song called “MELTDOWN” on the album <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>seemingly dissed Timothée by</a> mentioning Willy Wonka. Timothée, of course, played the beloved character in the<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> Dec. 2023 remake of Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-21>“Wrappin’ the cheese, wrap around me ’cause I’ve got property,” Travis raps on the track, which features <strong><a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Drake</a>,&nbsp;</strong>per&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Genius</a>. “Chocolate AP [Audemars Piguet] and chocolate the Vs / got the Willy Wonka factory / Burn an athlete like it’s calories, find another flame hot as me, b****.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-22>Kylie and Timothée’s relationship has continued to progress. They were spotted kissing while <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>attending a Beyoncé concert</a> in Los Angeles on Sept. 4. Days later, the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>twosome sat together</a> during an intimate dinner for New York Fashion Week, per videos circulating on social media.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8qyo6KdXZ%2Byr7rEq2SdmaSeu6h5x6Kqraeirnp1fpRpbm1sXw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fkylie-jenner-dating-history-4250744.html&text=A%20Look%20Back%20On%20Her%20Relationships%20%20Hollywood%20Life&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fkylie-jenner-dating-history-4250744.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fkylie-jenner-dating-history-4250744.html&title=A%20Look%20Back%20On%20Her%20Relationships%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fkylie-jenner-dating-history-4250744.html&title=A%20Look%20Back%20On%20Her%20Relationships%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fkylie-jenner-dating-history-4250744.html&title=A%20Look%20Back%20On%20Her%20Relationships%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fkylie-jenner-dating-history-4250744.html&description=A%20Look%20Back%20On%20Her%20Relationships%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./hot-air-balloon-crash-lands-near-road-leicestershire.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Heartstopping moment hot air balloon crash lands near busy road forcing motorists to swerve in panic">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-austin-obrien-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Austin O'Brien Dating Now">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
