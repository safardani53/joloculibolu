After his stint at the record company,&nbsp;he served as the managing director of EMI Records Germany. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p dir=ltr>His job in EMI took him from Germany to Switzerland and served with EMI in a similar capacity with the EMI Recorded Music, Switzerland.&nbsp;He is the man behind the curtains who is responsible for the success of artists like Pink Floyd, Paul McCartney, Pet Shop Boys, Queen, Radiohead and his wife Tina Turner.</p><p dir=ltr><strong>Oprah's Next Chapter: </strong>Erwin Bach chats in an interview with his wife on Oprah's Show (Published on Aug 26, 2013)</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p dir=ltr>The musical genius is also an actor and has appeared in Maldito Amar: Demasiado (1999), and&nbsp;60 Minutes (1968).

I have a good life. I don’t need to interfere with that. For some people, marriage means “You’re mine now.” That can be the beginning of the failure of a relationship. Psychologically, something happens when someone says, “You’re my husband or wife. You can’t do this or that.” It’s about ownership. That freedom that two people loving each other and wanting to be together – and being able to leave if anything is wrong – is gone.</p><p dir=ltr>She further added that she never felt the urge to get married. She added that she was very happy with her relationship and did not want to get married just to please a random person,&nbsp;</p><p dir=ltr>Neither Erwin nor I feel the need to get married. We’ve been together for 18 years. What would marriage give me that I don’t already have? Marriage would be about pleasing the public. Why do I need to please the public if I’m already pleased?’</p><p dir=ltr>His wife Tina was previously married to Ike Turner and faced abuse and violence in the relationship. Tina divorced with her abusive husband citing violent behavior. She has two children from the first wedding Raymond Craig and Ronnie Turner and divorced in 1976.&nbsp;</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><h3 dir=ltr><strong>3.

Erwin Bach's Sacrifice For Love: Donated Kidney To His Wife</strong></h3><p dir=ltr>Marriage is a sacred bond and it comes with compromise, commitment, and sacrifice. Tina became a Swiss citizen for her husband likewise Bach too did something really big for her.</p><p>As his wife suffered from a kidney disease in 2016 she needed a kidney transplant. And in that moment of need, the longtime partner turned husband Erwin donated one of his kidneys to his beloved wife. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p><strong>Know about:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# title="Ryan Kwanten Gay?
