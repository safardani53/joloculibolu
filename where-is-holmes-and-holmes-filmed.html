Years ago, Mike "MJ" Holmes had his girlfriend (now wife) Lisa move in with him. So he and his dad, Mike Sr., got to work renovating his place from a "bachelor bungalow" to the perfect place for two. Years later, father and son are still working together on their show <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Holmes and Holmes</a>.</p>Article continues below advertisement<p>Over the years, fans have loved watching this father/son duo bring new life to houses, but they want to know: Where is Holmes and Holmes actually filmed? It's shown in the U.S. but is actually based in another country. In fact, the family has a bunch of other home renovation programs.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@mikeholmesjr</a></figure>Article continues below advertisement<h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Where is 'Holmes and Holmes' filmed?</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MJ's Instagram</a>, Holmes and Holmes is primarily filmed in Ontario, Canada. He tags many of his posts in the area and informs his followers about things specific to the city. This makes sense considering he works with his family, who are also based there.</p><p>Over time, Mike Sr. has shown just how dedicated he is to his work. He's been in the construction field for decades, and it's been noticed by the Canadian government. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his website</a>, Mike has been officially acknowledged by the "Canadian House of Commons for his promotion of skilled trades and advocacy for improved building standards."</p>Article continues below advertisement<p>In addition, Mike also created the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Holmes Approved Homes</a> program in 2012. It was created to set safety and quality standards in the industry. His philosophy is based on building homes that buyers can trust to be constructed right the first time.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Mike Holmes (@make_it_right)</a></p></figure>Article continues below advertisement<p>On top of that, Mike is a National Spokesperson for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Skills Canada</a>.

He's also an ambassador for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WorldSkills</a> which aims to promote these fields.</p><p>"I’ve been involved in World Skills and Skills Canada for years — and it’s a program that I love because it makes our young tradespeople feel like absolute rock stars as they take the next steps in their career in the trades," Mike said on his website.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Mike Sr. also has a ton of other shows.</h2><p>Mike works with MJ on Holmes and Holmes, but that's not to be confused with the show Holmes on Homes. Although the two are very similar, Mike hosts Holmes on Homes without his son. His show is about helping families who have been taken advantage of or had their projects abandoned by previous contractors.</p>Article continues below advertisement<p>But wait, there's more. These two shows don't make up the network of TV programs this family has developed over the years.
