Boss Jim Gamble, who ran the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Command until 2010, told The Sun on Sunday: “We try to provide information that helps parents and teachers so they can engage with their children in a way that makes sense.</p><p>"We are most definitely not promoting Furries or the issues associated with it.</p><p>“What we are doing is providing advice on fandom and cosplay.”</p><p>Mr Gamble insists his organis­ation has seen no evidence of Furries in any <a href=#>school </a>he deals with and believes the vast majority of cases are hoaxes.</p><p>But he said: “Educating and empowering parents so they are able to deal with this is really important. We make it very clear there are significant risks.</p><p>“Our advice is there to allow parents to have a sensible and sensi­tive con­ver­sation with their child and highlight risks.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/furry-fandom-subculture-interested-fictional-826830172.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/chool-children-now-identifying-furries-826824051.png><p>Mr Gamble said the Government needs to introduce national guide­lines for schools on identity issues.</p><p>But he added: “By over-reacting and over-magnifying the issue we feed an unhealthy curiosity.</p><p>“At the end of the day a human being is not a cat.”</p><p>Sir John Hayes, chairman of the Common Sense Group of <a href=#>Tory MPs</a>, said: “This idea that we can all choose to be anything we want to be — so I can choose to be a giant, or you can choose to be a flying creature — is preposterous nonsense.</p><p>"Do we really need guidance on this?</p><p>“I dressed up — as a little boy — in various costumes and so did my children.</p><p>"Role play is an important part of children’s learning. But it is exactly that, role play. It’s not about their fundamental identity.”</p><p>Former teacher Liz Arnold, 49, said that in her 20-year career she had one child identify as a cat.</p><p>She said: “Because it was a very young child, other pupils simply accepted it. It wasn’t an issue.</p><p>“So I question the need for intricate guidance for families and teachers.”</p><p>This week it emerged<a href=#> schools are allowing kids</a> to identify as cats, horses and dinosaurs in class, and teachers are doing little to question such behaviour.</p><p>And there was outrage when a 13-year-old was<a href=#> branded “despic­able”</a> by a teacher at <a href=#>Rye College</a> in East Sussex for rejecting a class­mate’s claim she identified as a cat.</p><p>Education Secretary <a href=#>Gillian Keegan</a> has<a href=#> ordered a probe</a> into the incident.</p><p>Education reformer Katha­rine Birbalsingh, founder of the Michaela School in West London, said she knew of a school pupil who iden­tifies as a gay male hologram.</p><p>A <a href=#>Department for Education</a> spokesman said: “It is com­pletely inapprop­riate for schools to treat a pupil as an animal or inanimate object and it is important parents are able to raise con­cerns with schools and that schools engage ser­iously.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>What are furries?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/0da0bb80-3553-46d4-b635-487c8cb5ebb3.jpg><p>FURRIES are people who have an active interest in anthropomorphism, or giving human characteristics to animals.</p><p>The characters are often made up by the community members themselves, who create an avatar known as a “fursona”.</p><p>A fursona interacts with others in the community via role-playing and art.</p><p>Some Furries make colourful costumes for their characters called “fursuits” and usually wear them in a public forum, either in person or online.</p><p>Those in the community see being a Furry as a safe, functional way to explore who you are as a person, including<a href=#> gender identity</a> and sexual orientation.</p><p>The Furry community holds worldwide conventions and “meets” where Furries can have real-life encounters.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>Originating in <a href=#>California </a>in the mid-1980s, there are now hundreds of furry conventions worldwide annually.</p><p>A group called LondonFurs holds monthly meets for UK-based Furries.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/b695047d-f4b2-4de5-8909-a56a5707e1ad.jpg><br><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">Wrong to say kids can't have opinion</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>EXCLUSIVE by Jaya Narain</p><p>PARENTS of pupils at the school in the centre of a storm over a child identifying as a cat blasted teachers for dragging “gender politics” into the classroom.</p><p>A teacher at Rye College in<a href=#> East Sussex</a> branded a pupil “despicable” for questioning her classmate’s odd request.</p><p>In a secret recording the angry teacher, who has not been named, can be heard telling the 13-year-old girl her view that gender was <a href=#>binary </a>was “very sad”.</p><p>The teacher tells the pupil: “If you don’t like it you need to go to a different school”, before the child says: “How can you identify as a cat when you’re a girl?”</p><p>The teacher told two Year 8 pupils that they were being reported to a senior leader and were no longer welcome at the school if they continued to express their views.</p><p>The teacher added they needed a “proper educational conversation about equality, diversity and inclusion”.</p><p>Now parents say the pupils are stressed and tearful about expressing their opinions.</p><p>One couple with a child in Year 7 said their daughter had been left in tears by the incident.</p><p>They claimed there was too much focus on “<a href=#>woke</a>” gender issues and not enough on education.</p><p>The child’s mum said: “All this gender politics is stressing the children out and it’s wrong to tell them they can’t have an opinion.</p><p>"I know a lot of parents who are very supportive of the two girls involved — they’re very bright and the point they were making was reasonable.</p><p>"Everything has gone woke. Teachers should concentrate on teaching and shouldn’t be telling them they don’t belong in school.”</p><p>The family, who live in Rye, said they were “shocked” by<a href=#> the audio clip </a>and said their previous experience of the school had been positive.</p><p>The girl’s dad said: “Listening to the audio clip made me angry. The teacher had no right to say a pupil’s opinion is wrong.</p><p>"It’s an opinion, for goodness’ sake. We should be encouraging our children to have opinions, as long as they’re reasonable.</p><p>“Our daughter isn’t in that year group but she was crying about the fuss and stress it has caused.</p><p>"It’s highlighted how gender politics has taken over schools. It’s not good. I feel heads across Britain need a clear plan on this issue.”</p><p>After meetings between the Department for Education and Rye College, the school has hit back, saying none of its pupils “identify as a cat or any other animal”.</p><p>Prime Minister<a href=#> Rishi Sunak</a> also <a href=#>commented</a> on the row, saying teachers should not be “shutting down debate” between pupils.</p><p>This week <a href=#>The Sun revealed </a>that under new government guidance, schools will be banned from letting kids change their gender if their ­parents say no.</p><p>Rye College is a co-educational secondary with academy status, with around 570 pupils</p><p>Its last <a href=#>Ofsted </a>report ranked it as “good”.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ395fJBybHFnoJa%2FprrTrGStnZGYtaa%2B0maumqqemrFuv8Khpqikm56xtHnFrqmroZWofA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fparents-teachers-warned-schoolkids-furries.html&text=Parents%20and%20teachers%20warned%20not%20to%20ridicule%20schoolkids%20who%20identify%20as%20animals&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fparents-teachers-warned-schoolkids-furries.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fparents-teachers-warned-schoolkids-furries.html&title=Parents%20and%20teachers%20warned%20not%20to%20ridicule%20schoolkids%20who%20identify%20as%20animals" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fparents-teachers-warned-schoolkids-furries.html&title=Parents%20and%20teachers%20warned%20not%20to%20ridicule%20schoolkids%20who%20identify%20as%20animals" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fparents-teachers-warned-schoolkids-furries.html&title=Parents%20and%20teachers%20warned%20not%20to%20ridicule%20schoolkids%20who%20identify%20as%20animals" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fparents-teachers-warned-schoolkids-furries.html&description=Parents%20and%20teachers%20warned%20not%20to%20ridicule%20schoolkids%20who%20identify%20as%20animals" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./russell-brand-and-wife-laura-gallacher-are-expecting-baby-no-3.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Russell Brand and Wife Laura Gallacher Are Expecting Baby No. 3">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./kourtney-kardashian-nipple-ring-sheer-black-mini-dress-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kourtney Kardashians Nipple Ring In Sheer Black Mini Dress  Photos  Hollywood Life">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
