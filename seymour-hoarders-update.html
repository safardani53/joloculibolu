Many of the people featured have trouble throwing things away even though they're broken or have no use, or they're constantly shopping or otherwise bringing things into their home. This leads to them having homes full of objects that make it difficult to navigate their own space.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>But one person who has really stuck with Hoarding viewers is Seymour. The former surgeon had a really bad roach infestation. And along with his health issues, it didn't look good for him. Even now, fans are still concerned. The episode aired years ago, but are there any updates about where he is now? Here's what we know.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Who is Seymour from 'Hoarding: Buried Alive'?</h2><p>We first met Seymour in a Season 8 episode of the TLC show in March 2014. Living in Philadelphia, he was a retired orthopedic surgeon whose hoarding led to a huge cockroach infestation in his home. It turned out that he'd started bringing things into his home more than a decade earlier, after going through a tough divorce with the mother of his children.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>To help him get past this chapter of his life, Seymour's children and their spouses all tried over the years to get him to clean up his home. But it never worked, and his home continued to get worse over time. In fact, it got so bad that the cockroach infestation followed him wherever he went, even when he would leave the home. His daughter-in-law said that she got an infestation from him when he visited her.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is there an update about Seymour from 'Hoarding: Buried Alive'?</h2><p>Unfortunately, not much is known about what happened to Seymour after the show aside from the update that was given at the end of the Hoarding episode. But on the bright side, that update was a positive one. It said that he ended up moving into a retirement home and he began building a relationship with his granddaughter in a clean space. That aired back in 2014, and it's unclear what's going on with him and his family now.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Some people in the comments of a clip on YouTube said that Seymour's retirement home allows him to have an "apartment"-style home to himself that allows him to have his own space. And that same comment section is full of people wishing him the best. Many people are talking about how sad his living situation was and that it looked like he genuinely wanted the help after years of turning his kids away.</p><p>Some commenters also said that they feel Seymour's kids were too mean to him, while others are just hoping he's gotten the help he deserves. "This absolutely breaks my heart," wrote one commenter. "Such an intelligent and driven man. A pharmaceutical degree AND a medical degree. It sounds like he just fired himself out to the point of this. Very sad."</p><p>You can watch Hoarding: Buried Alive on Discovery Plus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqLK6uc6uqWagn5a%2FpbHRrGSuqJSWwaY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fseymour-hoarders-update.html&text=Is%20There%20an%20Update%20on%20Seymour%20of%20%27Hoarding%3a%20Buried%20Alive%27%3f%20Details&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fseymour-hoarders-update.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fseymour-hoarders-update.html&title=Is%20There%20an%20Update%20on%20Seymour%20of%20%27Hoarding%3a%20Buried%20Alive%27%3f%20Details" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fseymour-hoarders-update.html&title=Is%20There%20an%20Update%20on%20Seymour%20of%20%27Hoarding%3a%20Buried%20Alive%27%3f%20Details" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fseymour-hoarders-update.html&title=Is%20There%20an%20Update%20on%20Seymour%20of%20%27Hoarding%3a%20Buried%20Alive%27%3f%20Details" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fseymour-hoarders-update.html&description=Is%20There%20an%20Update%20on%20Seymour%20of%20%27Hoarding%3a%20Buried%20Alive%27%3f%20Details" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./man-of-style-travis-fimmel-appeared-as-calvin-klein-model-to-lumbersexual-vikings.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Man of Style Travis Fimmel: Appeared as Calvin Klein Model to Lumbersexual Vikings">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./landon-gordon.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fame | Landon Gordon net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
