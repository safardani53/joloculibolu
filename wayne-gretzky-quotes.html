He played the entire 20 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL) and four teams between 1979 and 1999.</p><p>Moreover, he is regarded as one of the greatest and influential hockey players by other players, sportswriters, and the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NHL</a> itself. He has also been the leading scorer in the history of NHL with maximum goals. His contribution to the sport is maximum, but in 1999, when he was retired, he held 61 NHL records.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/The-Great-One-Wayne-Gretzky.jpg><p>Similarly, he has motivated many youngsters to do what they love and also obtained the nickname “the Great One.” Here are a few of the quotes by Wayne Gretzky that would help you too.</p><p>“I skate to where the puck is going to be, not where it has been.” —Wayne Gretzky</p><p>“Listen, everything I have in my life is because of the NHL and because of hockey, and I love the game and I loved every minute of being a player, I loved coaching, I loved being involved in the NHL.” —Wayne Gretzky</p><p>“By no means could I play at the level of these kids who play in the NHL now but as 50-year-olds go, I feel really good and I feel blessed that I’m still healthy.” —Wayne Gretzky</p><p>“Ninety percent of hockey is mental and the other half is physical.” —Wayne Gretzky</p><p>“I don’t like my hockey sticks touching other sticks, and I don’t like them crossing one another, and I kind of have them hidden in the corner. I put baby powder on the ends. I think it’s essentially a matter of taking care of what takes care of you.” —Wayne Gretzky</p><p>“I couldn’t beat people with my strength; I don’t have a hard shot; I’m not the quickest skater in the league. My eyes and my mind have to do most of the work.” —Wayne Gretzky</p><p>“It’s an honor and a thrill and a privilege just to play in the NHL.” —Wayne Gretzky</p><p><strong>8th of 26 Wayne Gretzky Quotes</strong></p><p>“A good hockey player plays where the puck is. A great hockey player plays where the puck is going to be.” —Wayne Gretzky</p><p>“Hockey is a unique sport in the sense that you need each and every guy helping each other and pulling in the same direction to be successful.” —Wayne Gretzky</p><p>“I knew at a young age, whether I was playing baseball or hockey or lacrosse, that my teammates were counting on me, whether it be to strike the last batter out in a baseball game or score a big goal in a hockey game.” —Wayne Gretzky</p><p>“I wasn’t naturally gifted in terms of size and speed; everything I did in hockey I worked for, and that’s the way I’ll be as a coach.” —Wayne Gretzky</p><p>“I think that from the time you start playing sports as a child, you see that your responsibility to your team is to play the best that you can play as an individual… and yet, not take anything away from being part of a team.” —Wayne Gretzky</p><p>“You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take.” —Wayne Gretzky</p><p><a href=#>56 famous Dennis Rodman Quotes</a></p><p>“I get a feeling about where a teammate is going to be. A lot of times, I can turn and pass without even looking.” —Wayne Gretzky</p><p>“Procrastination is one of the most common and deadliest of diseases and its toll on success and happiness is heavy.” —Wayne Gretzky</p><p><strong>16th of 26 Wayne Gretzky Quotes</strong></p><p>“The only way a kid is going to practice is if it’s total fun for him… and it was for me.” —Wayne Gretzky</p><p>“The highest compliment that you can pay me is to say that I work hard every day, that I never dog it.” —Wayne Gretzky</p><p>“Most people marry their mother. I married my father.” —Wayne Gretzky</p><p>“And people who know me would tell you that away from hockey, I’m really not that competitive.” —Wayne Gretzky</p><p>“I’m very proud of our NHL players. I think they all handle themselves extremely well and they all work really hard.” —Wayne Gretzky</p><p>“When I was 5 and playing against 11-year-olds, who were bigger, stronger, faster, I just had to figure out a way to play with them.” —Wayne Gretzky</p><p>“Look at guys like <a href=#>Larry Bird</a> and George Brett and<a href=# rel=noopener> John McEnroe</a>; that’s what they did in their careers. They all wanted to be the guy under the microscope late in the game or late in the match. So you just take on that know-how that that’s part of your responsibility, and you learn that’s what makes it exciting. That’s what makes it fun!” —Wayne Gretzky</p><p><a href=#>134 Inspiring Tom Brady Quotes</a></p><p>“I just like to keep my money in the bank; I’m not a big risk-taker. I don’t know anything about the stock market… I stay away from things I don’t know anything about.” —Wayne Gretzky&nbsp; &nbsp;<strong>23rd &nbsp;of 26 Wayne Gretzky Quotes</strong></p><p>“Growing up, I was always the small guy.” —Wayne Gretzky</p><p></p><p>“My kids are no different than anyone else’s – they tend to disagree with everything I say!” —Wayne Gretzky</p><p>“The biggest difference between L.A. and Edmonton was that instead of people looking at me, I was looking at them.” —Wayne Gretzky</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunDDwLKlnmWXp7K1xsqyZKqtn6mytHs%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwayne-gretzky-quotes.html&text=26%20Motivating%20Wayne%20Gretzky%20Quotes&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwayne-gretzky-quotes.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwayne-gretzky-quotes.html&title=26%20Motivating%20Wayne%20Gretzky%20Quotes" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwayne-gretzky-quotes.html&title=26%20Motivating%20Wayne%20Gretzky%20Quotes" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwayne-gretzky-quotes.html&title=26%20Motivating%20Wayne%20Gretzky%20Quotes" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwayne-gretzky-quotes.html&description=26%20Motivating%20Wayne%20Gretzky%20Quotes" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./celebrity-deaths-2023-who-died.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Celebrity deaths 2023  Stars who have died this year">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./super-mario-world.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Super Mario World - Watch on Paramount Plus">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
