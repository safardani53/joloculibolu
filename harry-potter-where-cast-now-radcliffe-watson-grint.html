are Emma Watson, Daniel Radcliffe, and the others now?</h2><p>The Harry Potter cast has continuously stayed busy – with recent acting roles in <a href=#>films</a> and <a href=#>TV</a> series, weddings, and starting their own families.</p><p>In February 2023,&nbsp;however, senior executives <a href=#>exclusively told The U.S. Sun</a> that Warner Bros is looking to bring Harry Potter And The Cursed Child to the big screen.</p><p>Until then, here is what the stars have been up to since the decade-long franchise wrapped up:</p><h2>Daniel Radcliffe</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000633836151.jpg><p><a

Potter</h2><p>In the days since he played "the boy who lived," Radcliffe has stayed busy acting in a mix of TV series and movies.</p><p>Radcliffe acted as Prince Chauncley in the TV series Miracle Workers, and Igor in the 2015 movie Victor Frankenstein.</p><p>He recently reprised his role and <a href=#>read the first chapter of Harry Potter</a> and the Philosopher's Stone –&nbsp;the first book in the series.</p><p>As the series' author, <a href=#>JK Rowling</a>, faced backlash for comments that were slammed as transphobic in 2020, Radcliffe <a href=#>penned a letter apologizing to the community</a> and saying: "trans women are women."</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in Entertainment</h2></p><h2>Emma Watson</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2021/02/NINTCHDBPICT000633836055.jpg><p><a href=#>Emma Watson</a>, 32, has kept herself busy starring in a number of movies since playing the book-smart and quick-witted Hermione Granger.</p><p>She starred as Sam in The Perks of Being a Wallflower (2012), Belle in the 2017 live-action Beauty and the Beast, and Meg March in Little Women (2019).</p><p>Watson has been an active feminist –&nbsp;and in 2014 was appointed a <a href=#>United Nations</a> Women Goodwill Ambassador.</p><p>She made headlines in 2019 when she described herself as "self-partnered" –meaning <a href=#>she is committed to living happily without a romantic partner</a>.</p><p>Although, ahead of the recent reunion, the Hermione Granger actress confessed when she was 11 she had a crush on Draco Malfroy star&nbsp;Tom Felton, who was 14 at the time.</p><p>Watson<a href=#> joined co-star Radcliffe in slamming Rowling's</a> tweets that were dubbed "anti-trans" last summer.</p><p>“Trans people are who they say they are and deserve to live their lives without being constantly questioned or told they aren’t who they say they are," Watson said.</p><h2>Rupert Grint</h2><img

rel="noreferrer noopener">Tom Felton</a>, 35, has become a bit of a heartthrob in recent days.</p><p>The Mirror previously reported that Tom was paid $14million to appear in the movies - despite only being on screen for a total of 31 minutes and 45 seconds.</p><p>Felton and his character became the center of "Draco-Tok" –&nbsp;a community of Harry Potter <a href=#>TikTok</a> fans that made videos surrounding Draco Malfoy and creating their own narratives with him.</p><p>Since his days as a Slytherin, Felton has acted in movies including Risen (2016), Stratton (2017), and Ophelia (2018).</p><p>He smashed rumors that he and former co-star Watson were dating as he joined the dating app, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Raya</a>.</p><p>Felton <a href=#>hosted an epic 19-year

Snape.</p><p>Following his days as the head of the house of Slytherin, Rickman acted in films like Gambit (2012), CBGB (2013) and voiced Absolem in the 2016 film, Alice Through the Looking Glass.</p><p>Following a battle with pancreatic cancer, <a href=#>Rickman died in January 2016</a> at the age of 69.</p><p>He won a number of awards throughout his life, including a <a href=#>Golden Globe</a> in 1997, a Primetime <a href=#>Emmy</a> in 1996, and a BAFTA in 1992.</p><h2>Matthew Lewis</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto
