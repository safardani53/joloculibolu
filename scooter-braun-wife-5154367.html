The business mogul has provided management to many of the biggest names in music through his SB Projects company, and he’s been involved with other huge businesses that promote artists, including his label Schoolboy Records, holding company Ithaca Ventures, and HYBE Corporation. Of course, he’s also taken some heat over the years, notably for his feud with&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Taylor Swift&nbsp;</strong></a>over her master recordings. Many of Scooter’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>biggest</a> <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>clients</a> (like&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Ariana Grande </strong></a>and <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Demi Lovato</strong></a>)&nbsp;have also reportedly <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>dropped him</a> as a <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>manager in recent weeks,</a> according to various reports.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/scooter-braun-yael-Braun-5-things-ss-embed1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-3>By his side for a huge part of his career was his ex-wife, <strong><a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Yael Cohen</a>,&nbsp;</strong>36. The activist, who was born in South Africa, was married to Scooter from 2014 to 2022. While she’s in an entirely different business than her ex-husband, she’s very successful in her own business ventures. Find out more about Yael and her marriage to Scooter here.</p><h2>How Did Yael Meet Scooter?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-4>Scooter reached out to Yael after hearing her speak about her non-profit&nbsp;F**k Cancer. “I saw [a video of] her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TEDx Talk,</a>” he told&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Architectural Digest </a>in 2018. “I just really wanted to meet her.” After getting in touch with Yael, they started dating, and they got married in 2014. The couple exchanged their vows at Yael’s parents’ home in Whistler, British Columbia in Canada.</p><h2>Yael Founded A Non-Profit To Fight Cancer</h2><p id=content-paragraph-5>Yael created F**k Cancer in 2009. The organization “is dedicated to advancing health equity through early detection and prevention programs, and by providing resources to navigate, manage, and cope with cancer,” according to its <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>website</a>.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>She’s been vocal about using the expletive in their name to try to stand out and bring attention to the important issue that is cancer. They try to prevent cancer, help with early detection, and provide support to those fighting cancer. Yael serves as the board chair in addition to being a co-founder.</p><h2>She & Scooter Have Three Kids</h2><p id=content-paragraph-7>Throughout their seven-year marriage, Scooter and Yael had three children. Their first son <strong>Jagger Joseph,&nbsp;</strong>8, was born in 2015. Their second son&nbsp;<strong>Levi Magnus,&nbsp;</strong>7, arrived in 2016. Their third child and only daughter&nbsp;<strong>Hart Violet,&nbsp;</strong>5, was born in 2018.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/scooter-braun-yael-Braun-5-things-ss-embed2.jpg><h2>They Split Up In 2021</h2><p id=content-paragraph-8>After seven years of marriage, Scooter <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>filed for divorce</a> in 2021. He cited “irreconcilable differences” and requested joint custody of the kids in his legal filing. Their <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>divorce was finalized</a> in 2022, and he reportedly paid her $20 million and was ordered to pay $60,000 per month in child support.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Shortly before their split, the SB Projects founder had gushed about Yael on their seventh anniversary in an Instagram post. “If just for the kids you have given me everything. But thanks to you I have grown, I have been pushed to be the best version of myself and to continue growing and learning,” he wrote at the time. “That all happened because you came into my life. 7 years. The adventure is just beginning. Thank you Yae. I love you. Happy Anniversary.”</p><h2>Yael Stood Up For Scooter Amid His Taylor Swift Feud</h2><p id=content-paragraph-10>While Scooter has been involved with tons of huge artists, he’s perhaps most infamous for the feud with Taylor Swift, after his Ithaca Ventures bought Big Machine Records. After the “Cruel Summer” singer called out the music industry executive, Yael did come to his defense in an Instagram <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>post</a>. “I have never been one for a public airing of laundry, but when you attack my husband… here we go,” she wrote, before calling out Taylor. “And girl, who are you to talk about bullying? The world has watched you collect and drop friends like wilted flowers. My husband is anything but a bully, he’s spent his life standing up for people and causes he believes in.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9Kcpqislad6o77ArqVmr5mbsm6BkG5rbG5nZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fscooter-braun-wife-5154367.html&text=All%20About%20His%20Marriage%20To%20Yael%20Cohen%20%20Hollywood%20Life&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fscooter-braun-wife-5154367.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fscooter-braun-wife-5154367.html&title=All%20About%20His%20Marriage%20To%20Yael%20Cohen%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fscooter-braun-wife-5154367.html&title=All%20About%20His%20Marriage%20To%20Yael%20Cohen%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fscooter-braun-wife-5154367.html&title=All%20About%20His%20Marriage%20To%20Yael%20Cohen%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fscooter-braun-wife-5154367.html&description=All%20About%20His%20Marriage%20To%20Yael%20Cohen%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./celeb-body-transformations-movies-pics-weight-gain-roles-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Celeb Body Transformations For Movies: Photos  Hollywood Life">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./adam-levine-blake-shelton-the-voice-season-23-finale-last-episode.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Adam Levine Honors Blake Shelton During The Voice Season 23 Finale  Hollywood Life">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
