"He had been deliberately and repeatedly assaulted, beaten, and put into and held under a cold bath as a punishment.</p><p>"That unlawful course of conduct, that unnecessary punishment, was carried out jointly by Carla Scott and Dirk Howell.</p><p>"It was their actions that led to his death".</p><p>Ms Heeley added: "Dirk Howell believed in discipline, on the face of it not a bad thing when bringing up young children, but whereas you might think of discipline as being the naughty step, or having set bedtimes, for Dirk Howell discipline was far more physical and psychological."</p><h2>BEGGING FOR HELP</h2><p>Neighbours told the court they had heard little Alfie begging to be let inside the home.</p><p>Haunting footage captured Alfie's screams as he repeated "let me in, let me in" after being locked outside.</p><p>And he was ultimately found lifeless in a dark and "dirty" room on February 18, 2021.</p><p>PC Stacey Hegenbarth, of West Mercia Police, <a href=#>recalled finding the poor boy</a>, saying: "There was a boy who was completely naked lying on a wooden floor, a young boy, and a female I now know to be the mother giving chest compressions.</p><p>"There was a large, dirty, badly stained mattress on the floor. No bedding, no bed.</p><p>"The floor was dirty and sticky. I think there was a broken wardrobe in one corner. Just very untidy.</p><p>"But I recall downstairs, the living room and kitchen, I would describe it as a show home. It was spotlessly clean.</p><p>"It was the polar opposite upstairs, it was a completely dishevelled property."</p><p>PC Hegenbarth also said that Scott had explained some of the little boy's facial injuries by saying that he had fallen off his bike without a helmet.</p><p>Bodycam footage was previously played to jurors showing a sobbing Scott allegedly lying to&nbsp;<a href=#>police</a>&nbsp;after stricken Alfie was found.</p><p>She can be heard telling officers: "I think he banged his head when he was in the bath because he's got an [inaudible] on his head."</p><p>The mum then phones Howell to tell him Alfie has been taken to&nbsp;<a href=#>hospital</a>&nbsp;but "they won't let me go up there yet".</p><p>She said: "There's loads of police, they've got detectives and everything".</p><p>Scott ends the call by telling Howell "I love you too" and making a kissing noise down the phone.</p><h2>'FAMILY, WHERE LIFE BEGINS'</h2><p>The footage shows Scott in her living room, which has the words "family, where life begins" stencilled on the wall.</p><p>Coventry Crown&nbsp;<a href=#>Court</a>&nbsp;was also played a 999 call she made claiming Alfie had "fallen asleep" and drowned in the bath.</p><p>Scott tells the operator she can "feel a rattle" on his chest but says he is not breathing and making "lots of gargling noises".</p><p>The mum adds: "He fell asleep in the bath. He's got&nbsp;<a href=#>asthma</a>. When he was a baby he got pneumonia."</p><p>Minutes later, footage played to jurors showed&nbsp;<a href=#>Howell being arrested</a>&nbsp;as he attempted to board a train at Droitwich station.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="READ MORE SUN STORIES">READ MORE SUN STORIES</h2><p>A cop asks him "What's your name buddy?" before Howell replies: "Dirk Howell, why?"</p><p>The officer says: "I need to have a quick chat with you…right ok well, put your hands up for me, so at the moment, you are under arrest on suspicion of attempted&nbsp;<a href=#>murder</a>."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/alfie-steele-see-swns-story-819578122.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/gone-hospital-wont-let-go-820091138.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/2021-court-heard-alfie-died-819923186-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/body-cam-cameras-captured-landing-820090381.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2021-nine-year-old-covered-814396237.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/use-ids-confirmed-mum-carla-637184957-1.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKynZpOke7a3jqecsKtfZ393gpJtcGpnkaGzqrGMrKuenZyaeq7BzGadopmemLJus9Sio62xXaC2rbjIp55o</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2falfie-steele-mum-fiance-guilty-killing.html&text=Mum%20%26amp%3b%20fiance%20GUILTY%20of%20killing%20Alfie%20Steele%2c%209%2c%20after%20beating%20boy%20and%20holding%20him%20down%20in%20bath%20in%20ca&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2falfie-steele-mum-fiance-guilty-killing.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2falfie-steele-mum-fiance-guilty-killing.html&title=Mum%20%26amp%3b%20fiance%20GUILTY%20of%20killing%20Alfie%20Steele%2c%209%2c%20after%20beating%20boy%20and%20holding%20him%20down%20in%20bath%20in%20ca" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2falfie-steele-mum-fiance-guilty-killing.html&title=Mum%20%26amp%3b%20fiance%20GUILTY%20of%20killing%20Alfie%20Steele%2c%209%2c%20after%20beating%20boy%20and%20holding%20him%20down%20in%20bath%20in%20ca" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2falfie-steele-mum-fiance-guilty-killing.html&title=Mum%20%26amp%3b%20fiance%20GUILTY%20of%20killing%20Alfie%20Steele%2c%209%2c%20after%20beating%20boy%20and%20holding%20him%20down%20in%20bath%20in%20ca" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2falfie-steele-mum-fiance-guilty-killing.html&description=Mum%20%26amp%3b%20fiance%20GUILTY%20of%20killing%20Alfie%20Steele%2c%209%2c%20after%20beating%20boy%20and%20holding%20him%20down%20in%20bath%20in%20ca" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./nicki-minaj-quick-change-2-fluffy-neon-looks-nyc-photos-8414707.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Nicki Minaj Slays a Quick-Change in 2 Bold Fluffy Neon Looks">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./mike-muir-19630314-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mike Muir (Punk Singer) - Age, Birthday, Bio, Facts, Family, Net Worth, Height &amp;amp; More">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
