History has shown that the player between the sticks can make a huge difference.</p><p>Oliver Kahn, Edwin van der Sar, Peter Schmeichel, Petr Cech, Iker Casillas, and many others have demonstrated how a goalkeeper can contribute to a team’s success. Even today, the most successful teams have some of the world’s best goalkeepers.</p><p>Goalkeepers tend to improve with age As we have seen with most goalkeepers, their understanding of the game improves over time. They can predict it better and impose their authority more forcefully because they have more experience.</p><p>Some of the best goalkeepers in the game today are over the age of 30, and they still appear strong and fit for years to come. On that note, here are the best goalkeepers over the age of 30 in the world right now:</p><h2>Number 5: Samir Handanovic (Inter Milan)-37 years old</h2><p>Samir Handanovic, arguably one of the best goalkeepers of his generation, has been a fantastic servant for Inter Milan. The Slovenian goalkeeper has made 340 appearances for the Nerazzurri in Serie A.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Samir-Handanovic-1.jpg><p>The 37-year-old has a commanding presence in the box and has been an important player between the posts. His quick reflexes and acrobatic saves have frequently come to Inter’s aid. He was instrumental in helping them win the Serie A title in 2020-21.</p><p>Samir Handanovic has kept 100 league clean sheets for #Inter, more than any other goalkeeper in Serie A. (since he joined the Nerazzurri). Insurmountable.</p><p>In 2009, 2011, and 2012, the former Udinese goalkeeper was named Slovenian Footballer of the Year. With 26 saves, Handanovic currently holds the record for the most penalty saves in Serie A. He is unquestionably a legend at the Italian club.</p><h2>Number 4: Kasper Schmeichel (Leicester City) – 34 years old</h2><p>Kasper Schmeichel has become a household name in the Premier League as a result of his consistent performances over the years. He has done incredibly well at the highest level, making his father, the great Peter Schmeichel, proud.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Kasper-Schmeichel-1.png><p>The Danish goalkeeper has been a key player for Leicester City. Kasper Schmeichel has good catching abilities and has been very smart with his positioning. His command of the box has been crucial in assisting the Foxes in maintaining discipline at the back.</p><p>Kasper Schmeichel made nine saves, including a penalty, against England, the most by a Danish goalkeeper in a single European Championship game.</p><p>He has been named Danish Footballer of the Year in 2016, 2017, 2019, and 2020 as a result of his outstanding performances over the years. Kasper Schmeichel was instrumental in Leicester City winning the Premier League in 2015-16 and the FA Cup in 2020-21. The 34-year-old is unquestionably one of the best goalkeepers in the Premier League at the moment. His recent contributions to the Danish national team have also been quite impressive.</p><h2>Number 3: Keylor Navas (Paris Saint-Germain) – 34 years old</h2><p>The Costa Rican goalkeeper is currently with Paris Saint-Germain, and while he is no longer a regular starter, he is still an important player for the French club. Before moving to Paris, Keylor Navas had a memorable time with Real Madrid.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Keylor-Navas-1.jpg><p>He isn’t the tallest goalkeeper but compensates with his quick pace and quick reflexes. His agility and energy on the ice allow him to make some acrobatic saves. Despite his inconsistency at times, Navas is a dependable goalkeeper.</p><p>The former Levante goalkeeper won the UEFA Champions League with Real Madrid three times a row. He is regarded as one of the greatest footballers in the history of the Confederation of North, Central, and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF).</p><h2>Number 2: David de Gea (Manchester United) – 30 years old</h2><p>The Spanish goalkeeper has been a devoted and passionate Manchester United player. After rising through the ranks at Atletico Madrid, David de Gea joined Manchester United in 2011 to play under Sir Alex Ferguson.’</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/David-de-Gea.jpg><p>Since then, the shot-stopper has made 349 Premier League appearances. De Gea has incredible reflexes, and his shot-stopping abilities with both his hands and feet have been outstanding. While Manchester United has struggled since Sir Alex Ferguson’s retirement, De Gea’s performances have remained consistent.</p><p>The former Atletico Madrid man struggled a little last season but has come back strong this season. He is still an important player for Manchester United, and it is admirable that he has remained so loyal to the club despite previous interest from Real Madrid.</p><h2>Number 1: Manuel Neuer (Bayern München) – 35 years old</h2><p>Manuel Neuer was the first to propose the sweeper-keeper concept. The German goalkeeper has simply been outstanding for both Bayern Munich and Germany.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Manuel-Neuer-i.jpg><p>The 35-year-old has been regarded as one of the best goalkeepers in the game’s history. One of the highlights of his game style has been his incredible ability to rush off the goal and assist his defense. This enables his teammates to maintain a high defensive line without fear of being caught off the shoulder.</p><p>Neuer has had a lot of success in his career, and no one can deny that it is well-deserved. In his career, he has won the UEFA Champions League twice and been named the Best European Goalkeeper five times.7</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiZnqukYrSwrcuknJ6olafAbrvFZquhnV2svLO4w2g%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbest-goalkeepers-of-the-world.html&text=Top%205%20Best%20Goalkeepers%20Of%20The%20World%20Over%20The%20Age%20Of%2030&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-goalkeepers-of-the-world.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-goalkeepers-of-the-world.html&title=Top%205%20Best%20Goalkeepers%20Of%20The%20World%20Over%20The%20Age%20Of%2030" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbest-goalkeepers-of-the-world.html&title=Top%205%20Best%20Goalkeepers%20Of%20The%20World%20Over%20The%20Age%20Of%2030" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbest-goalkeepers-of-the-world.html&title=Top%205%20Best%20Goalkeepers%20Of%20The%20World%20Over%20The%20Age%20Of%2030" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-goalkeepers-of-the-world.html&description=Top%205%20Best%20Goalkeepers%20Of%20The%20World%20Over%20The%20Age%20Of%2030" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./louella-sheridan-baby-died-hospital-alarm-monitor.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Two-month-old baby girl died after hospital staff turned off the alarms on her monitor, inquest hear">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./khloe-kardashian-spilled-the-beans-on-tristian-thompsons-proposal-on-the-kardashians.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Khloe Kardashian Spilled The Beans On Tristian Thompsons Proposal On The Kardashians">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
