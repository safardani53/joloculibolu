See if you still want that glass of red…</p><p>When we’re dehydrated, we can often feel tired and sluggish – triggering cravings for coffee</p><span class=quote-credit>Lara Hughes</span><span class=quote-credit-meta>Nutritionist and founder of Wholistic Health by Lara</span><h2 id=pizza>Pizza</h2><p>Most people love carbs, whether that's pizza, pasta or a slice or two of toast.</p><p>Lara says that these foods are incredibly glucose dense, so sugar/wine and carb cravings often go hand-in-hand.</p><p>She explains that you might crave these foods if you are tired, as they are quick sources of energy.</p><p>"Cravings might appear when you’re skipping meals, on a restrictive diet (which comes with added emotional drivers of cravings),&nbsp; compromising your sleep and in need of additional fuel -&nbsp; or coming down from a sugar-high and on the proverbial blood sugar rollercoaster", Lara says.</p><p>Lara explains that you might also fancy a delicious pizza if you're feeling a bit down in the dumps.</p><p>That is because refined carbohydrates not only increase feel good hormones (serotonin) and make us feel more motivated (dopamine), but help us to absorb the amino acid,&nbsp; tryptophan (found in various animal products)— which facilitates the production of both serotonin and sleep-inducing melatonin.</p><h2 id=caffeine>Caffeine</h2><p>If you find it difficult to surpass your local <a href=#>coffee</a> shop en route to work, there’s a good chance you could be caffeine-dependent.</p><p>Lara says the main reason you will be yearning caffeine, is due to dehydration.</p><p>"Water is key for all bodily processes – including metabolism and energy.</p><p>"When we’re dehydrated, we can often feel tired and sluggish – triggering cravings for coffee."</p><p>She advises that next time you’re contemplating a&nbsp;fourth cup of coffee, opt for a few glasses of water (aim for 2 Litres daily), and see if you still feel quite so sluggish.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">How can I prevent cravings?</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>CRAVINGS are a normal feeling but they can get in the way of you having a healthy, balanced diet.</p><p>Signe said that in order to prevent your cravings you should:</p><ul><li>include nutritious foods in your diet, rather than exclude certain foods</li><li>eat an adequate amount of energy during the day</li><li>eat balanced meals rich in fibre, protein and unsaturated fat&nbsp;</li><li>have an adequate amount of sleep&nbsp;</li></ul><h2 id=sweets-and-cakes>Sweets and cakes</h2><p>While you might not be able to stop thinking about the gorgeous cupcake you spotted, the expert says that the longing is actually all in your head.</p><p>She explains that the need for these sorts of foods are fuelled by particular neurotransmitters (chemical messengers in your brain), which also act as hormones.</p><p>"If your “feel good” hormone (serotonin) dips, sugar can temporarily increase it, making you feel better, whilst when your&nbsp; stress hormone (cortisol) is on the increase, you’re driven towards sugar-rich, survival-promoting foods, contributing to “anxious eating”.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>She said that are three main reasons you might have a sweet tooth:</strong></p><ul><li>you haven't fuelled properly</li><li>you're coming down off a sugar high</li><li>you're addicted.</li></ul><p>If any of these sound like you then the guru says the more you stay away from sugary foods, then the more your neurotransmitters will re-balance, and the less you’ll experience sugar aches.</p><p>"Instead, don’t skip meals, and fill up on balanced foods, like fibre-rich wholegrains; whole, fresh fruits and vegetables; healthy fats like avocados and nuts; and lean sources of protein, all of which slow the release of glucose into your blood and stabilise both your energy and cravings."</p><p>She adds that to help with this you could use a supplement like &nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CORREXIKO marine collagen powder</a>.</p><h2 id=chips>Chips</h2><p>If you want nothing more than a bag of chips from your local chippy, then Signe says this could be down to dehydration, or a very rare sodium deficiency.</p><p>"Other good sources of hydration include water, sparkling water or foods rich in water.&nbsp;</p><p>"If you want a more nutritious option than chips to curb your sodium cravings try olives, pickles and vegetables with a low-fat Greek yogurt dip", she suggests.</p><h2 id=chocolate>Chocolate</h2><p>We all love a little bit of chocolate every now and then, but if you crave it all the time, the Lifesum expert says this may be due to low levels of magnesium.</p><p>Other good sources of magnesium include dark leafy greens, beans, lentils, nuts and seeds, she says.</p><h2 id=ice-cream>Ice cream</h2><p>As temperatures hot up on the approach to summer, you might reach for an ice cream.</p><p>But if you want soft serve all the time, then this could be down to low levels of calcium.&nbsp;</p><p>As an alternative, Signe says other good sources of calcium include dark leafy greens, low-fat Greek yogurt and tofu.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The Sun">Read More on The Sun</h2><h2 id=soft-drinks>Soft drinks</h2><p>Craving <a href=#>fizzy drinks</a> could be down to dehydration, Signe says,</p><p>If you find yourself wanting a lemonade or a cola, then opt for water, sparkling water or foods rich in water such as melons, oranges, strawberries, lettuce and cucumber, she suggests.</p><p><h3 class="article-boxout__headline t-s-border-color">We pay for your stories!</h3></p><p class=article__content--intro>Do you have a story for The Sun news desk?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57x56YpayYZIJ0fo9xZ2xnnqrBs7XToqanZZWtvaa%2B02auoZmkYrOwu8NmmquZpp67qL%2BMq5yapJyueq6xwKdm</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fnutrition-expert-what-food-cravings-really-mean.html&text=Im%20a%20nutrition%20expert%20and%20heres%20why%20your%20food%20cravings%20could%20mean%20something%27s%20wrong&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnutrition-expert-what-food-cravings-really-mean.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnutrition-expert-what-food-cravings-really-mean.html&title=Im%20a%20nutrition%20expert%20and%20heres%20why%20your%20food%20cravings%20could%20mean%20something%27s%20wrong" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fnutrition-expert-what-food-cravings-really-mean.html&title=Im%20a%20nutrition%20expert%20and%20heres%20why%20your%20food%20cravings%20could%20mean%20something%27s%20wrong" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fnutrition-expert-what-food-cravings-really-mean.html&title=Im%20a%20nutrition%20expert%20and%20heres%20why%20your%20food%20cravings%20could%20mean%20something%27s%20wrong" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnutrition-expert-what-food-cravings-really-mean.html&description=Im%20a%20nutrition%20expert%20and%20heres%20why%20your%20food%20cravings%20could%20mean%20something%27s%20wrong" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./record-breaking-horse-trainer-quits.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Record-breaking horse trainer shocks racing by quitting and says 'I've got sheep to look after'">&larr;
