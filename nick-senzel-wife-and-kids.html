Nick and Emily share one kid, Nick Jr, born in 2021.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>The Georgia native didn’t waste much time after he found the right person. Emily and <a href=# rel=noopener>Nick</a> hardly dated for a year before announcing their engagement. And shortly after their engagement, the couple brought a new life to the world.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/nick-senzel-emily-senzel.jpg><p>A graduate of The University of Tennesee, Emily Senzel has been the rock of her husband’s life. The Senzel family has turned into a perfect baseball family, especially since the arrival of their son.&nbsp;</p><p>The Cincinnati Reds center fielder had a tough couple of seasons. The overall second pick of the 2016 draft, Senzel looks ready to shred the persona of just a top prospect in the 2023 season.&nbsp;</p><h2>Nick Senzel And His Wife Emily Relationship Timeline</h2><p>In 2021, Nick Senzel’s wife, Emily Senzel, graduated with a master’s degree in Speech-language pathology from The University of Tennessee.&nbsp;</p><p>The proud husband couldn’t help but share an appreciation post for his better half on his Instagram handle. And this is one of many appreciation posts Nick has shared about Emily on his Instagram page.&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s learn more about the lovely couple and their relationship.&nbsp;</p><h3>Nick And Emily Go Public With Their Romance&nbsp;</h3><p>The baseballer shared one of the first pictures with Emily in June 2020. A year after his MLB debut, the Georgia native was pictured with the brunette on a boating trip.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/nick-senzel-with-emily-davis.jpg><p>A few weeks later, Senzel, during the All-Star break, shared a couple of pictures with Emily, captioning the post, “My Love,” indicating the love part with a heart sign emoji.&nbsp;</p><p>We probably could’ve seen more of the baseball couple’s dating life if it weren’t for Emily’s Instagram handle being private. But on Facebook, Emily shared a picture of her and Nick with the same caption as above.&nbsp;</p><h3>The Baseballer Goes Down On One Knee</h3><p>Things moved pretty quickly for Nick and Emily in 2021. They had just begun dating, and now they were engaged.&nbsp;</p><p>The Reds player shocked his fans as he announced his engagement with Emily. “Why wait if you have found the right one?” was probably a motto of Nick when it came to dating.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/nick-senzel-engagement.jpg><p>He shared a picture of Emily flashing a wide smile and showing her ring as he hugged her from the side. The proposal took place on January 9, 2021.</p><p>A month later, on Valentine’s Day, Nick shared an appreciation post for his fiance. He also acknowledged the fact that it was their first Valentine’s Day.&nbsp;</p><h3>The Couple Tie The Knot In 2022</h3><p>Nick and Emily haven’t shared a single picture from their wedding ceremony on their Instagram handle, but they are well and truly married.</p><p>On the website, <a href=# rel=noopener>The Knot</a>, their wedding date has been noted to be February 10, 2022, in Islamorada, Florida. Before that date, on his Instagram posts, Nick referred to Emily as his “future-wife-to-be.”&nbsp;</p><p>But for the Valentine’s Day post in 2022, Nick has captioned the post indicating his marital status and referring to Emily as his wife.&nbsp;</p><h2>Nick Shares A Baby Boy With Emily&nbsp;</h2><p>The baseball couple, Nick and Emily Senzel, share a baby boy, whom they have named, Nicholas Peter Senzel II or, in short, Nick Jr.</p><p>Nick Jr was born on November 29, 2021, a few months before his parents’ wedding. The couple announced their pregnancy news on July 17, 2021, with Nick holding an ultrasound picture and Emily cradling her baby bump.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/nick-senzel-with-son.jpg><p>The couple also had a gender reveal ceremony that followed a baseball theme. In the video shared by Nick, Emily can be seen tossing a baseball at Nick, and he launched his shot, a blue smoke dispensed out of it.</p><p>With his parents, Nick Jr. celebrated his first Halloween dressing up as a chef of the famous cake manufacturer company, Pillsbury. Little Nick has already known what it is like to travel for baseball games, as he was seen last year at Fenway Park rooting for his dad.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmionJbGpr7Sm6CoZpOkunC6yJyiZquVo8emuIywoJ%2BdXZa7pXnKopusZw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fnick-senzel-wife-and-kids.html&text=Meet%20Nick%20Senzel%20Wife%20Emily%20Senzel%3a%20Married%20Life%20And%20Kids&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnick-senzel-wife-and-kids.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnick-senzel-wife-and-kids.html&title=Meet%20Nick%20Senzel%20Wife%20Emily%20Senzel%3a%20Married%20Life%20And%20Kids" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fnick-senzel-wife-and-kids.html&title=Meet%20Nick%20Senzel%20Wife%20Emily%20Senzel%3a%20Married%20Life%20And%20Kids" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fnick-senzel-wife-and-kids.html&title=Meet%20Nick%20Senzel%20Wife%20Emily%20Senzel%3a%20Married%20Life%20And%20Kids" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnick-senzel-wife-and-kids.html&description=Meet%20Nick%20Senzel%20Wife%20Emily%20Senzel%3a%20Married%20Life%20And%20Kids" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./who-is-jinder-mahal-dating.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Jinder Mahal Dating Now">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./maci-bookout-clarifies-comments-about-son-cutting-weight.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Maci Bookout Clarifies Comments About Son 'Cutting Weight'">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
