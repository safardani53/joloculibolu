He can be wildly charismatic, but also terrifying”.</p><p>He has long been a staunch and very loyal supporter of The <a href=#>Holly </a>And Phil Show.</p><p>If there are metaphorical bodies buried, one might assume Frizell knows where.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in The Sun</h2></p><p>ITV Head of Daytime Emma Gormley also has questions to answer.</p><p>Why was <a href=#>Phillip’s ex-boyfriend</a> moved to <a href=#>Loose Women</a> once relations cooled? Who was that to protect?</p><p>On February 1, 2020, I emailed the ITV publicity team, putting to them allegations that This Morning was dubbed “Toxic Towers” by staff members — and that a would-be tribunal, for claims of <a href=#>bullying</a> and misogyny, was settled out of court.</p><p>In no uncertain terms, I was told a “thorough internal investigation [was undertaken] and we are happy these complaints are unfounded”.</p><p>Yet, puzzlingly, I can reveal a six-figure sum was given to the disgruntled employee.</p><p>The resulting article never saw the light of day.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/f94e3a61-b645-4756-971d-44f45e443db0.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/3bbf168f-7bf9-4900-bc52-0799ac228d9f.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/itv-head-daytime-emma-gormley-818989025.jpg><p>And back in June 2019, I first revealed tensions between Phil and Holly and a “bust-up” at a Birmingham Live event.</p><p>Although I was well-briefed by several people, some famous, some not, both Holly and Phil did their utmost to downplay any tensions.</p><p>Other journalists have also levelled accusations of unpleasant off-sofa behaviour, and been similarly thwarted.</p><p>On Sunday, <a href=#>Dr Ranj</a>, who previously worked on the show, appeared to confirm it all.</p><p>He said: “Over time I grew increasingly worried about things behind the scenes and how people, including myself, were being treated.</p><p>“It takes more than one person to create a culture.”</p><p>One of my best friends worked at a very senior level on the show a few years ago; she quit within six months and cited bullying and sexism in her exit interview. No action was taken.</p><p>I’d love to repeat a few choice conversations she witnessed. Even<a href=#> Jim Davidson</a> might wince.</p><p>Two well-known faces tell me they were diagnosed with medical conditions — one mental, one physical — as a result of working on the show.</p><p>The latter WhatsApped me yesterday saying: “I still suffer daily with the pain of this condition, but I don’t wish to look weak by coming out and discussing it.”</p><p>Yesterday, Phillip <a href=#>loyally defended</a> the programme he’s worked on for 21 years, adding: “The thousands of guests over the years, thousands of staff and crew, hundreds of presenters and contributors all know, it IS a family of wonderful, talented, kind, hardworking people.”</p><p>Quick as a flash,<a href=#> Eamonn Holmes</a> hit back, retorting: “Schofield has just put out a delusional statement.”</p><p>The gloves are well and truly off.</p><p>Naturally, there are hundreds of decent, kind, hardworking and smart This Morning employees — ones who must be reading about the fall-out and be heartbroken.</p><p>They must also, unfairly, fear for their jobs.</p><p>It’s also important to note that the show — and Frizell and co — worked tirelessly during the pandemic and, over the years, have raised invaluable awareness on a plethora of health issues, quite probably saving lives in the process.</p><p>But ITV, which proudly launched a <a href=#>Mental Health</a> In The Media campaign in March, cannot now sit back and do nothing.</p><p>It is duty bound to investigate both its initial “investigation” and launch a fresh one.</p><p>In the meantime, it’s business as usual for bullish bosses.</p><p>This Morning aired yesterday, filled with its usual sunny bonhomie (which, now, none of us believe in).</p><p>But for how much longer can this farce continue?</p><p>An ITV spokesperson said: “As a producer and broadcaster, ITV takes its responsibilities around speaking up seriously.</p><p>"We have robust and established processes in place.”</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Boris: Give it a rest</h2><p>THE year is 2043.

No.</p><p>But a “barbecue”? Totally socially acceptable to make like Augustus Gloop.</p><p>IN what may well become a regular, exciting feature called Bench Of The Week, these past few days I’ve been inundated* with readers’ photos revealing their favourite park bench plaques.</p><p>After showing off Huw Davies’ memorial “In loving memory of Huw Davies who used to sit here and shout f*** off at the seagulls”, this week we have a successor.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/roger-bucklesby-plaque-clemmie-moodie-821388335.jpg><p>Thanks to Rob Bull for this week’s winner and, as Rob wrote: “I’d have had a beer with Roger.”</p><p>Ditto. *12 readers</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Kylie snub is age blunder by Beeb</h2><p>FOR a painfully woke, left-leaning organisation, the BBC really does know how to shoot itself in the foot.</p><p>Radio 1 was refusing to playlist <a href=#>Kylie Minogue</a>’s new song – a belter – because she is far, far too old for their yoof demographic.<br>Sure, Kylie is 55.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-digitally-retouched-kylie-minogue-820065884-1.jpg><p>But she’s a global icon who transcends age, gender, sexuality and class.</p><p>I don’t know a single gay man under 30 who doesn’t worship the hotpanty ground she walks on.</p><p>In contrast, stations including Capital FM are playing the song, Padam Padam.</p><p>At the same time, this is a corporation single-handedly hell-bent on bringing over younger listeners to<a href=#> Radio 2</a> – and culling DJs over 60.</p><p>So while people’s pronouns must be respected, loos gender neutral, historical facts re-imagined and trigger warnings slapped on, the one thing the BBC doesn’t respect is life experience.</p><p>In an ageing society, this is looking increasingly short-sighted.</p><p>FAREWELL to <a href=#>Jeff Stelling</a>, who received a standing ovation at the end of his<a href=#> final shift</a> this weekend.</p><p>He is that rare broadcaster about whom it is virtually impossible to say anything derogatory.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/hartlepool-united-president-sky-tv-820388951.jpg><p>After 30 years at the <a href=#>Soccer Saturday</a> helm, he is a nigh-on impossible act to follow.</p><h2 class=has-text-align-center>Art of losing face</h2><p>OH, the horror. Is it just me or is it LITERALLY CATEGORICALLY IMPOSSIBLE to end an accidental FaceTime call?</p><p>At the risk of sounding all<a href=#> Piers Morgany</a> here (sorry Piers), I accidentally sat on my mobile and video-called a very famous pop star whose name rhymes with Dobby Dilliams (yes, yes, I can hear that name-drop bell clanging).</p><p>Upon realising my error, I frantically scrabbled to shut the thing down.</p><p>Nothing. It just kept ringing and ringing and ringing, my ever-more flushed giant fat face and seven chins looming on the small screen before me.</p><p>The more wild-eyed and frantic I got, the louder the ring tone seemed to get. The (screened) call was INTERMINABLE. I must have looked like a veritable stalker.</p><p>As a side-note, I also once FaceTimed my boss from the loo and the exact same thing happened. The shame.</p><p>MY friend sent me a screenshot of a Hinge (dating app) match she had – with the other person citing their sexuality as “allosexual”.</p><p>Er, what?
