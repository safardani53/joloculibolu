Also, he has a younger sibling named <strong>Andrea Pennington.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Chad has loved sports since he was a child. He initially played basketball and later began playing football during his first year at high school.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/chad-pennington.jpg><p>According to the horoscope, Chad is a <i>Cancer</i>. People with Cancer as their sun sign are mostly known for their protective and intuitive nature.</p><h3>Age, Height, and Body Measurements</h3><p>Chad, aka “The Golden Boy,” turned 45 years old. He possesses an athletic build and stands at the height of 6’ 3” (1.91 m), and weighs around 230 lbs (104 kgs).</p><p>Also, he has dark brown eyes and blonde hair.</p><h3>Education</h3><p>Furthermore, Chad started attending&nbsp;Webb School of Knoxville in eighth grade. There he played several sports like basketball, football, and baseball.</p><p>However, he was more passionate about football and knew that he would have great chances of getting offers from colleges through football.</p><p>Moreover, two colleges were interested in recruiting Chad: the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga and Middle Tennessee State University.</p><p>Chad decided to attend the training camp at his parent’s alma mater, Marshall University. Meanwhile, Jim Donnan, head coach of Marshall University’s football team, noticed Pennington and offered him a scholarship.</p><h2>Chad Pennington | Career and Profession</h2><h3>NFL Draft</h3><p>The New York Jets selected Chad as the 18th overall and the first quarterback during the first round of the NFL Draft 2000.</p><p>Pennington was one of the six quarterbacks who were drafted before <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Tom Brady</a></strong>.</p><h3><span id=New_York_Jets class=mw-headline>New York Jets</span></h3><p>Pennington made only three appearances in his first two seasons and became the fifth-round starting quarterback.</p><p>Moreover, Chad helped lead the Jets’ from 1–4 to a 9–7 record and towards the AFC East division championship.</p><p>Similarly, in the season, his quarterback rating of 104.2 set a new team record.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/chad.jpg><p>Unfortunately, during the fourth pre-season game while playing against the New York Giants, Chad got hit by the Giants’ linebacker, Brandon Short, and suffered from a fracture-dislocation on his left hand.</p><p>Because of his injury, Chad missed the first six games of the 2003 regular season. Furthermore, the severity of his injury and the hurried rehab process caused his wrist never to be the same.</p><p>Hence, his exceptional play fake turned thoroughly ordinary. Going into the 2004 season, the New York Jets signed a seven-year contract worth<strong> $64.2 million</strong> with Pennington.</p><p>Likewise, while playing against the Buffalo Bills, his rotator cuff got injured, making him miss three games.</p><h4>Feud with the New York Media</h4><p>Throughout the 2004 season, Chad had a feud with the local New York media. Moreover, on December 20th, 2004, Chad scolded the media assembled during news conferences.</p><p>He told them that covering for the Jets and being around many professional athletes daily is not the media’s right but a privilege.</p><h4>Surgery</h4><p>During the 2005 season of the NFL, on February 4th, 2005, Chad had to undergo surgery on his right shoulder, which was caused due to a right rotator cuff tear and a large bone spur on the same shoulder.</p><p>Moreover, in the following games after his surgery, Chad’s dismal performance while playing against the Kansas City Chiefs and Miami Dolphins led to the speculation that he was not fully healed from his injury.</p><p>However, Chad and Herman Edwards, Jets coach, denied the speculation and explained that it was due to a lack of practice in the preseason.</p><p>Furthermore, Pennington underwent surgery on his right shoulder again on October 6th, 2005.</p><p>The team expected that he would have better control and strength in his throws with more time spent on rehabilitation.</p><h4>Post Surgery</h4><p>After his surgery, Pennington entered the 2006 season and trained with new throwing coaches. At the time, the Jets appointed a new coach Eric Mangini.</p><p>Mangini stated to the team players and the press that the player starting in the quarterback position is uncertain. Hence, all four of their quarterbacks have an equal chance.</p><p>Besides, to ensure Chad’s shoulder safety, the Jets’ medical staff limited him on his throws.</p><p>Moreover, Chad won the pre-season quarterback competition of the Jets and started in the 2006 season.</p><p>He recorded his career’s first back-to-back 300-yard passes, and his exceptional performance earned Chad the AFC Offensive Player of the Week honors.</p><p>Furthermore, even after being criticized for his lack of arm strength, he played with significant improvement and won the award of Comeback Player of the Year.</p><h3><span id=Miami_Dolphins class=mw-headline>Miami Dolphins</span></h3><p>Chad was released by the Jets after acquiring <a href=# rel=noopener>Brett Favre</a>. Reportedly, after his release, six teams were interested in having Pennington on their team.</p><p>Among them, Miami Dolphins and Minnesota Vikings were severe competitors.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/chad-2-1024x728.jpg><p>Likewise, Pennington signed a two-year contract worth <strong>$11.5 million</strong> with the Miami Dolphins on August 8th, 2008.</p><p>While representing Dolphins in his role during the teams’ ten-win turnaround, Chad received distinguished MVP consideration from numerous major media outlets.</p><p>Moreover, Chad received his career’s second Comeback Player of the Year Award&nbsp;after completing the 2008 regular season.</p><h4>Pennington’s Third Surgery</h4><p>Chad injured the same shoulder where he had two surgeries while playing against the San Diego Chargers during the third quarter on September 27th, 2009.</p><p>Moreover, the Dolphins announced that his MRI results contained a torn capsule in his throwing shoulder. Hence, Chad decided to have a third surgery on his shoulder.</p><p>Chad stated that he was unsure if he would get to play again, but he would try his best to rehabilitate the shoulder and get back to playing in the NFL. But later, the Dolphins officially placed him on the injured reserve.</p><h4>Career-Ending Injury</h4><p>After his third injury, the Dolphins re-signed Chad to a one-year deal worth <strong>$5.75 million&nbsp;</strong>if he started as the team’s quarterback, <strong>$4.2 million&nbsp;</strong>if he gets traded, or <strong>$2.5 million&nbsp;</strong>for being the backup quarterback to <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Chad Henne</a></strong>.</p><p>Moreover, on November 10th, 2010, the Dolphins named Chad the starting quarterback for the game against the Tennessee Titans.</p><p>Unfortunately, he suffered from a severe shoulder injury again. This particular injury was a potentially career-ending injury.</p><p>Although Chad attempted another comeback for the NFL in the 2011 season, he tore his&nbsp;ACL on March 31st, 2011.</p><p>He announced that he would work as an analyst during the 2011 NFL season for Fox Sports. On February 9th, 2012, Chad officially announced his retirement following his fourth shoulder surgery.</p><h2>Chad Pennington | <span id=Awards_and_highlights class=mw-headline>Awards and Achievements&nbsp;</span></h2><ul><li>2×&nbsp;NFL Comeback Player of the Year- 2006, 2008</li><li>Heisman Trophy finalist- 1999</li><li>2× NFL completion percentage Leader- 2002, 2008</li><li>William V.
