He's part of the <a href=#>Miami Heat</a>, making waves as their power forward and small forward. Jimmy is respected and beloved by basketball fans who can appreciate his passion and skill set.</p><p>Jimmy knows how to keep his head in the game whenever he’s on the basketball court with his teammates. Right now, though, the conversation about Jimmy has less to do with his basketball stardom (and whether or not he's related to the <a href=#>Michael Jordan</a>) and more to do with his new hair. What's up with Jimmy's new look?</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jimmy Butler began experimenting with new hairstyles in 2022.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>Was there a reason Jimmy decided to switch up his entire appearance in 2022? As seen in a video posted to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NBA's official Twitter</a>, he said he was simply having a good time by messing around with his fans.</p><p>He said, “I’m just messing with stuff to make the internet mad. That was my goal this summer and it worked." He further shut down the rumors about having fake hair sewn in when he said, “I don’t have any extensions. I don’t know what you’re talking about. I’m trying out a lot of new looks. Y’all like my baby face assassin look? It’s kind of cute, isn’t it? I really don’t know. I ain’t even thought about it.”</p><p>In addition to Jimmy’s new hair, he also shaved his beard off.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>That was the first time fans saw him without facial hair in a very long time. The internet seemed to have be divided about his hairstyle decision. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">One person wrote</a>, “Looks mad goofy.”</p><p>Another person added, “These comments have proven he’s made his point, y’all all in here talking about him so he had enough effect on you to comment so it doesn’t matter what you say, you’re in the comments talking about his look like he wanted lol and y’all think y’all clowning him.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">A third user</a>, on Twitter wrote, “Help this man. He needs a stylist, a barber, and a girl.”</p><p>One of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jimmy’s fans clapped back</a> by saying, “He’s got all three though? He made you mad too, didn’t he?”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Jimmy Butler showcased another new hairstyle in 2023, this time a perm.</h2><p>In October 2023, we saw yet another side to Jimmy, his "emotional state," as he put it, during a recent press conference. He further explained that his new look represents him being "one with [his] emotions."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Jimmy not only stepped out in public sporting black polished nails, but also permed hair that nearly touched the tops of his shoulders. Naturally, Jimmy's new hair sparked a response from social media, and, of course, the media in general.</p><p>While some began to seriously question Jimmy's intention, others used his new "do" as inspiration for memes.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Here’s what else is going on with Jimmy Butler right now.</h2><p>Jimmy’s hair is certainly making a statement among basketball lovers right now, but it isn’t the only update he’s got going on. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sports Illustrated</a>, Jimmy believes that he’s in the prime of his career. In fact, the NBA player reposted a photo of him gracing the cover of the magazine's 2023/2024 NBA Season Preview Issue.</p><p>He said, “I'm comfortable. I've got a good group around that allows me to just hoop and not worry about nothing on any given day. I've got shooters. We've got defenders around me and also some good players. Prime or not, I think that I am."</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Over Time Heroics</a> says the Miami Heat went through some highs and lows throughout their last professional season. Jimmy was obviously there with his team, doing his best to help the Heat succeed throughout that time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn7auudhmma6snJq%2FbrrEsGShmZmn</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjimmy-butler-new-hair.html&text=Jimmy%20Butler%20From%20the%20Miami%20Heat%20Is%20Rocking%20a%20New%20Hairstyle%20%20Again&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjimmy-butler-new-hair.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjimmy-butler-new-hair.html&title=Jimmy%20Butler%20From%20the%20Miami%20Heat%20Is%20Rocking%20a%20New%20Hairstyle%20%20Again" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjimmy-butler-new-hair.html&title=Jimmy%20Butler%20From%20the%20Miami%20Heat%20Is%20Rocking%20a%20New%20Hairstyle%20%20Again" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjimmy-butler-new-hair.html&title=Jimmy%20Butler%20From%20the%20Miami%20Heat%20Is%20Rocking%20a%20New%20Hairstyle%20%20Again" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjimmy-butler-new-hair.html&description=Jimmy%20Butler%20From%20the%20Miami%20Heat%20Is%20Rocking%20a%20New%20Hairstyle%20%20Again" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jinger-duggar-shares-favorite-memory-and-its-depressing-as-hell.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jinger Duggar's &amp;quot;Favorite&amp;quot; Memory is Depressing as Hell">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./wilbert-montgomery.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Fame | Wilbert Montgomery net worth and salary income estimation Jan, 2024">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
