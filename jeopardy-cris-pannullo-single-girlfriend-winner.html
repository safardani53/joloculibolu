I know he had a girlfriend." tweeted another.</p><p>"Cris from Jeopardy!, break up with your GF challenge. Me and any of my roommates are available to hang out," a third fan ridiculously prompted.</p><p>A fourth dreampt up: "I JUST WANNA SEE CRIS ANSWER QUESTIONS. THATS IT. NO ONE ELSE."</p><p>As a fifth argued: "Cris is too good-looking and too smart. A deadly combo. How do you live with someone like that?</p><p>"You can't win an argument with a hot smart person. Smh" - they added and also seemed have an ulterior motive.</p><p>Fans have also posted about his <a href=#>"very nice smile" and brooding black eyebrows </a>as he racks up win after win.</p><h2>CRIS WITH NO 'H'</h2><p>Cris - who flashes a&nbsp;<a href=#>signature thumbs-up</a>&nbsp;for each of his on-screen intros and "bounces around" to <a href=#>warm up before each game</a> - has no social media presence, so fans are wondering what he's all about.</p><p>He's revealed on-stage he has a rabbit named Lentils with his girlfriend Heather,&nbsp;<a href=#>correcting Ken quite sternly earlier</a>&nbsp;that no, you cannot feed rabbits the beans he's named after.</p><p>He also shared tonight his favorite movie is "Spaceballs" and is the oldest of five siblings.</p><p>He grew up watching the game show he's now dominating not unlike <a href=#>James Holzhauer</a> - so much so that execs are calling losing to him getting&nbsp;<a href=#>"Pannulo'd".</a></p><p>Cris was a contestant on <a aria-label="Millionaire (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Millionaire</a> in 2018 and went home with $5000.</p><p>A former competitor&nbsp;<a href=#>exclusively</a>&nbsp;told The U.S. Sun that before Cris takes the stage, he is not&nbsp;<a href=#>looking to mingle</a>&nbsp;and is indeed a bit of an enigma.</p><p>"He was very nice, very polite, but he did sit separately from everyone else. He was quiet and it was hard to get a read on him."</p><p>He's batting 37 correct and 41 incorrect on "Daily Double" clues, and is correct on 94 percent of clues total, which is astounding looks aside.</p><p>During one win,&nbsp;Ken exclaimed "Woah!" as Cris' totaled up a shocking $71,821 which was a personal record.</p><p>Jeopardy! legend&nbsp;<a href=#>Amy Schneider</a>'s highest single-day total was $71,400, and Cris beat her - at this point he has also earned more in 18 games than now-host Ken had in 2004.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>Cris now has the <a aria-label="ninth-longest (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ninth-longest</a> streak ever and is only behind Amy, Ken, <a href=#>Matt Amodio</a>, and James in terms of money won.</p><p>Worth mentioning that tonight is the anniversary of the night Ken <a aria-label="lost (opens in a new tab)" href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">lost</a> his 74-game winning streak all those years back on an infamous "Fed-Ex" Final Jeopardy!.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/fans-all-wish-cris-pannullo-779548784.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/fans-genuinely-scared-reigning-champ-779284215-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/11/host-mayim-bialik-shocked-celebrity-773468739-2.jpg><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57xKernqqklravucSnq2huaGWGdoWXaKGep6CWv6XFjJypoqtdpa6vutSlo6hlo567qLjEZp6iqpybv6qxzZ1ksKGeo7Kzew%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fjeopardy-cris-pannullo-single-girlfriend-winner.html&text=Jeopardy%21%20fans%20%27all%20have%20the%20same%20wish%27%20about%20Cris%20Pannullo%20as%20they%20lust%20after%20super-champ%20before%20he&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fjeopardy-cris-pannullo-single-girlfriend-winner.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fjeopardy-cris-pannullo-single-girlfriend-winner.html&title=Jeopardy%21%20fans%20%27all%20have%20the%20same%20wish%27%20about%20Cris%20Pannullo%20as%20they%20lust%20after%20super-champ%20before%20he" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fjeopardy-cris-pannullo-single-girlfriend-winner.html&title=Jeopardy%21%20fans%20%27all%20have%20the%20same%20wish%27%20about%20Cris%20Pannullo%20as%20they%20lust%20after%20super-champ%20before%20he" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fjeopardy-cris-pannullo-single-girlfriend-winner.html&title=Jeopardy%21%20fans%20%27all%20have%20the%20same%20wish%27%20about%20Cris%20Pannullo%20as%20they%20lust%20after%20super-champ%20before%20he" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fjeopardy-cris-pannullo-single-girlfriend-winner.html&description=Jeopardy%21%20fans%20%27all%20have%20the%20same%20wish%27%20about%20Cris%20Pannullo%20as%20they%20lust%20after%20super-champ%20before%20he" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kardashian-fans-theory-kris-jenner-plastic-surgery.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kardashian fans share wild theory Kris Jenner had secret plastic surgery and accuse momager, 66, of ">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./colton-underwood-the-bachelor-gay-good-morning-america.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Is Colton Underwood gay? | The US Sun">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
