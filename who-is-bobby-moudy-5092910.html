I am fundraising for them,” began a message from <strong>Mandy Castle</strong>, who started <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a GoFundMe account</a> for the Moudy family. “Bobby was a loving husband, father, brother and friend. On April 28th, he was a tragic victim of suicide. … His wife, Jennifer and their three children are in an emotional and financial crisis as he was their rock. If Bobby touched your life in any way, personally or through his fun family tik tok page, please consider helping his family through this devastating time.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-18>As of the morning of May 5, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the GoFundMe page</a> had raised nearly $60k of its $75k goal.</p><h2>He Reportedly Was Facing ‘Financial Pressures’</h2><p id=content-paragraph-19>As of May 5, there was no official cause of death or motivation given to why Bobby would take his own life.

He had such an impact on not only his family but those around him. He was and is still so loved by so many. He will forever be remembered. I hope you’re hugging Louie tight for us. We’re counting down the days until we see you again.</p><h2><strong>His Family Was Left In ‘Pain’ & ‘Sadness.’</strong></h2><p id=content-paragraph-25>On May 3, Bobby’s widow, <strong>Jenn Moudy, </strong>posted a message on Instagram. “A great post written by my cousin,” she wrote, before sharing the message from her family member: “We all have so many thoughts and feelings, but few words to express them. It’s hard to explain how one minute you’re heartbroken over the amount of pain and desperation he endured, and the next, you’re in a rage for the choice that he made. You have to keep reminding yourself to direct the anger at the choice and the sadness at the loss of an amazing dad, husband, son, brother, cousin, nephew, and friend.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-26>&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-29>“Death by suicide leaves your family without life insurance benefits and without full social security spousal support,” the cousin wrote towards the end. “Taking oneself out of the equation only adds more hardship to those left in the wake of this type of tragedy. Any way you can help Bobby’s family is greatly appreciated. There was not a bad bone in his body. He just made a very poor choice that has left his family without a home or any financial security.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-30>If you or someone you know is in crisis, call the&nbsp;<a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>National&nbsp;Suicide&nbsp;Prevention Lifeline</a>&nbsp;at 1-800-273-TALK (8255), or contact the Crisis Text Line by texting TALK to 741741.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme9ahpmaho2KvsK7BsmSmp6WZxm6Bj3JpcmlgZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-is-bobby-moudy-5092910.html&text=Who%20Is%20Bobby%20Moudy%3f%20TikTok%20Star%20%26amp%3b%20Father%20Of%203%20Dies%20By%20Suicide%20%20Hollywood%20Life&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-is-bobby-moudy-5092910.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-bobby-moudy-5092910.html&title=Who%20Is%20Bobby%20Moudy%3f%20TikTok%20Star%20%26amp%3b%20Father%20Of%203%20Dies%20By%20Suicide%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-is-bobby-moudy-5092910.html&title=Who%20Is%20Bobby%20Moudy%3f%20TikTok%20Star%20%26amp%3b%20Father%20Of%203%20Dies%20By%20Suicide%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-is-bobby-moudy-5092910.html&title=Who%20Is%20Bobby%20Moudy%3f%20TikTok%20Star%20%26amp%3b%20Father%20Of%203%20Dies%20By%20Suicide%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-is-bobby-moudy-5092910.html&description=Who%20Is%20Bobby%20Moudy%3f%20TikTok%20Star%20%26amp%3b%20Father%20Of%203%20Dies%20By%20Suicide%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./21-gifs-of-justin-bieber-acting-like-the-worlds-most-spoiled-bra.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="21 GIFs of Justin Bieber Acting Like the World's Most Spoiled Brat">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./episodes.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Ghosts Season 1 Episodes - Watch on Paramount+">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
