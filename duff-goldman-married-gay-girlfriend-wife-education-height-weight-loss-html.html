He has a younger brother Luke and older brother Willie. After receiving his education in history and philosophy from the University of Maryland, Baltimore Country, he went on to study at Culinary Institute of America at Greystone in California.</p><p><strong>You May Also Like:</strong>&nbsp;<a href=# title="Out Gay Sam Champion New Job After GMA Exit; What's His Salary Now?" rel=follow>Out Gay Sam Champion New Job After GMA Exit; What's His Salary Now?</a></p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><p>The former Ace of Cakes star, 43, began to work in kitchens from the age of fourteen. He served at several acclaimed culinary destinations, including the French Laundry, the Vail Cascade Hotel, and Todd English’s Olives before he returned to Baltimore in 2000 to become a personal chef. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-614 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Duff, who stands at the height of 5 feet 4 inch (1.63 meters), established his bakery a household name on the hit Food Network show Ace of Cakes, which aired for ten seasons. After becoming a professional pastry chef, he’s appeared on the Food Network Challenge, Iron Chef America, Oprah, The Tonight Show, and Man vs. Food. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The current judge on Food Network’s Holiday Baking Championship didn’t recognize himself when he had an impressive weight loss in three months in 2017. Duff even took to Instagram to show off his before and after weight loss picture with his fans. He told curious followers that he dropped his weight the “old school” way by “eating clean, riding a bike and lifting weights.”</p><h3><strong>Is Duff Goldman Gay?</strong></h3><p>The baker receives 'a lot of flak' for advocating gay marriage. In 2015,&nbsp; Duff partnered with chef Art Smith for the&nbsp;#101GayWeddings campaign, an attempt to give 101 same-sex couples a dream wedding. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>But, the veteran baker confessed that he does “get a lot of flak” for his outspoken support for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) rights, but that hasn’t impacted his attitude.</p><p><strong>Read Also:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# title="Geoff Tracy Biography: Age, Wife And Family To Net worth Of Restaurant Owner" rel=follow>Geoff Tracy Biography: Age, Wife </a><a href=# title="Geoff Tracy Biography: Age, Wife And Family To Net worth Of Restaurant Owner" rel=follow>And</a><a href=# title="Geoff Tracy Biography: Age, Wife And Family To Net worth Of Restaurant Owner" rel=follow> Family To Net worth Of Restaurant Owner</a></p><p>As of his personal love life, Chef Duff&nbsp;is so in&nbsp;love with his girlfriend, and he spontaneously proposed to her with butcher’s twine.</p><h3><strong>Duff Goldman Surprised His Girlfriend with Unplanned Proposal</strong></h3><p>It was just another normal day when the Ace of Cakes chef popped a marriage proposal to his girlfriend, writer Johnna Colbry with butcher’s twine. They have been dating since 2016. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Duff posted his romantic and quick engagement moment on his official <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Instagram</a> account on 3rd April&nbsp;2018, surprising all the fans with a picture of their hand locked in an embrace and showing off the unique ring. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p></p><p><strong>Seriously Dude?:</strong> Celebrity chef Duff proposed his girlfriend in a super sweet way on April 3rd, 2018 (Photo: <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Duff Goldman’s Instagram)</a></p><p>He wrote a beautiful caption where Duff said he was shaving his head when like a mule kicked to the heart and realized that he is ‘absolutely in love’ with Johnna and couldn’t imagine living another day without her in his life.</p><p><strong>You Don't Want To Miss:&nbsp;</strong><a href=# title="Bobby Flay On The Other Side With Girlfriend After Divorce; Married Life At Rest!" rel=follow>Bobby Flay On The Other Side With Girlfriend After Divorce; Married Life At Rest!</a></p><p>The “Super Baking Champion” judge also proclaimed that he didn’t plan the proposal and that just happened suddenly. He asked her to marry him, and she said yes.</p><p>Now that the Food Network star has proposed his girlfriend to marry him, the only conundrum remaining is the news of when will he get married&nbsp;and make her wife for the rest of his life.</p><h2><strong>Duff & His Fiance Are Getting Ready For Wedding&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>On 13 November 2018, Duff's fiance Johnna posted to her Instagram and shared a glimpse of her opening a gift during the bridal shower.&nbsp; <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-173 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Now that was a treat for the fans who are willing to know when the wedding is happening.

One caption had stood out was, 'I get to marry an angel.' <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-175 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>Aww, that was absolutely sweet of Duff.
