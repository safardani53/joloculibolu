Some of the other projects she worked on during her many decades in Hollywood also include&nbsp;<strong>George Lucas</strong>‘&nbsp;American Graffiti,&nbsp;The First Nudie Musical,&nbsp;Happy Days, and more. When the late 75-year-old wasn’t busy wowing on the set of amazing shows and movies, she was busy raising <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her kids</a> and spending time with her then-husband. Below is everything to know about Cindy’s marriage to musician <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Bill Hudson</strong></a>, 73, their life, and more amid the news of <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>her death</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Bill-Hudson-Cindy-Williams-ev-embed.jpg><h2>Who Was Cindy Williams’ Husband?</h2><p id=content-paragraph-3>Cindy was married only one time during her life. The late beauty met Bill when she was 35 years old and he was 33. Bill and his then-bride tied the knot in 1982 and had a long <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>marriage</a> that lasted until they <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>divorced</a> in 2000. There is not a lot that is publicly known about the private details of Cindy and Bill’s marriage, however, it is clear that it didn’t end up working out for the two.</p><p id=content-paragraph-4>Prior to Cindy, Bill was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>married</a> to&nbsp;Death Becomes Her&nbsp;star&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Goldie Hawn</strong></a>, 77, from 1976 until they divorced six years later. The falling out of this duo’s marriage was more public, with both of them speaking about it various times in recent years. During a 2016 interview on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Loose Women</a>, the blonde bombshell revealed why she wouldn’t re-marry after Bill. “We’ve been married before and it didn’t work so why do it again?”, Goldie said regarding her decades-long romance with actor&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kurt Russell</strong></a>, 71.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/cindy-williams-bill-hudson-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-5>Unfortunately, in 2011 Bill shared some words about Goldie to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The Daily Mail</a>, in which he slammed their time together. “I am sick and tired of her portraying this squeaky-clean image to the world when the reality of her life is so different. She is manipulative, cruel and selfish. I have done this book because I want to show the flip side of the Hollywood dream. I got caught up in Goldie’s world and I am still paying a painful price,” Bill said at the time. He released about his life that year titled&nbsp;2 Versions: The Other Side of Fame and Family Bill Hudson. <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>The musician</a> and Goldie welcomed two kids: actress&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Kate Hudson</strong></a>, 43, and their son&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link><strong>Oliver Hudson</strong></a>, 46.</p><h2>Did Cindy & Bill Have Kids?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/cindy-williams-emily-hudson-zachary-hudson-ss-embed2.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-6>During Cindy’s <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>marriage</a> to Bill, they then-couple welcomed <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>two kids</a>. During their first year as a married couple,&nbsp;The First Nudie Musical&nbsp;star and Bill welcomed a daughter, <strong>Emily Hudson</strong>, 41, in 1982. Emily came into their lives as Cindy was filming the seventh season of Laverne & Shirley, which she revealed during a 2015 interview with the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>TODAY&nbsp;</a>show. “I thought I was going to come back and they’d hide [her <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>baby bump</a>] behind benches, couches, pillows, and that wasn’t it,” she said at the time. “When it came time for me to sign my contract for that season, they had me working on my due date to have my baby. I said, ‘You know, I can’t sign this.’ And it went back and forth and back and forth, and it just never got worked out. Right after that, [shows] would build nurseries on sets.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>Later, Cindy gave birth to her son <strong>Zachary Hudson</strong>, 37, in 1986. Although her two adult children live a life out the public eye, they did show up to support their mom during her 2004 Hollywood Walk of Fame ceremony. Emily and Zachary are notably the half-siblings of Kate and Oliver. The&nbsp;Almost Famous&nbsp;star opened up about wanting to reconnect with her dad’s kids during a Jan. 2021 episode of her podcast,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Sibling Revelry</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/cindy-williams-ss-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>“You know what I’ve been thinking about lately? Dad,” Kate told Oliver at the time. “I’ve been thinking about our sisters that we don’t spend any time with and our brother — brothers. We’ve got <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>four siblings</a>&nbsp;we don’t spend any time with.” The blonde beauty continued, “We’ve been talking so much about sibling relationships and distraught relationships or good relations — and we’re sitting here like we have the best family, we’re so great and yet we don’t ever acknowledge the fact that we have four other siblings.”</p><h2>Cindy’s Passing</h2><p id=content-paragraph-9>Sadly, the phenomenal Hollywood starlet <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>died</a> at the age of 75 on Jan. 25, 2023, as confirmed by her family via <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow" data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a statement</a> to&nbsp;AP. “The passing of our kind, hilarious mother, Cindy Williams, has brought us insurmountable sadness that could never truly be expressed,” the statement via their rep read. “Knowing and loving her has been our joy and privilege. She was one of a kind, beautiful, generous and possessed a brilliant sense of humor and a glittering spirit that everyone loved.” According to her kids, Cindy passed away following a “brief illness” in Los Angeles.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGidnpmkqr%2Bme8KipZ2xXay2rbjImqSsZZiqwKOtzZ1kbmhhbYJ2f44%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fcindy-williams-husband-5018553.html&text=All%20About%20The%20Late%20Stars%20Ex%2c%20Bill%20Hudson%20%20Hollywood%20Life&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fcindy-williams-husband-5018553.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fcindy-williams-husband-5018553.html&title=All%20About%20The%20Late%20Stars%20Ex%2c%20Bill%20Hudson%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fcindy-williams-husband-5018553.html&title=All%20About%20The%20Late%20Stars%20Ex%2c%20Bill%20Hudson%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fcindy-williams-husband-5018553.html&title=All%20About%20The%20Late%20Stars%20Ex%2c%20Bill%20Hudson%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fcindy-williams-husband-5018553.html&description=All%20About%20The%20Late%20Stars%20Ex%2c%20Bill%20Hudson%20%20Hollywood%20Life" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./antonio-brown-children-wife.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Antonio Brown Has Six Children But Does Not Have Any Wife">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./dog-the-bounty-hunter-net-worth.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="What Is Dog the Bounty Hunter's Net Worth?
