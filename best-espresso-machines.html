After all, with the cost of your daily dose of caffeine on the rise — and long lines at Starbucks making the morning rush all the more stressful — the benefits of an at-home brewing solution have never been greater. (Even celebrities like Jennifer Aniston and Jessica Alba know the joy of a quick DIY cup.) But espresso machines can feel like an intimidating purchase: with an expansive range in both prices and technology, it might feel more like you’re getting a barista job than snagging an at-home luxury. But finding the right machine doesn’t have to be difficult.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When searching for the best espresso machine, coffee expert and Serious Eats writer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Jesse Raub</a> says that it’s only a matter of taste: “The more you try to define it, the harder it is going to be to create a level playing field — but basically pulling a good-tasting shot and then consistently being able to pull that shot multiple times in a row, those are the baseline goals.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Luckily, we did all the work for you.

We found that it may take some time to find the perfect grind for the machine (although finer grinds seemed to work best): at first, it made slightly watery, bitter shots. But when the grind was right, it pulled espresso shots in “viscous, honey-like streams” that remained consistently hazelnut in color and had a full body and a medium crema.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The milk frother was one of the stand-outs of this machine; with three foam settings and an automatic sensor that stops the wand instantly, it’s easy to use and produces velvety thick foam. That foam stood up well in cappuccinos and also remained a consistent 138 degrees Fahrenheit no matter the setting.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Breville Bambino Plus is also a breeze to set up and easy to clean with buttons that showcase setting options (this includes single shots, double shots, temperature, foam thickness, and steam wand). The biggest consideration before purchasing is that it doesn’t come equipped with a bean grinder; however, beginners can purchase espresso grinds at most supermarkets, while more advanced coffee connoisseurs should buy a high-quality grinder that allows customization to their preferences.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Grinder:</strong> No | <strong>Frother: </strong>Yes | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 12" H x 6.75" W X 12" D | <strong>Espresso Shot Pulls:</strong> Single and double | <strong>Machine Type:</strong> Semi-automatic</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-delonghi-stilosa-espresso-machine></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Budget</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>De'Longhi Stilosa Espresso Machine</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="De'Longhi Stilosa Espresso Machine" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/CseLZZr2vYOG3ZKzR-PaJONMRB0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/delonghi-stilosa-espresso-machine-22cb6ce79c13404090ef0d940a01e286.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Cleaning</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=0><p>This machine pulls high-quality shots – espresso was not bitter or acidic and tasted pleasantly robust with a near-perfect body and crema.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>This machine is consistently priced under $100.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>Some of the elements of this affordable machine are made of plastic.</p></li><li readability=1><p>The frother is a bit temperamental, producing more foam than hot milk thanks to overly powerful steam production.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Although this is an incredibly budget-friendly espresso machine, you won’t know it once you taste the results. As with many at-home machines, a learning curve and some experimentation with the amount of espresso and the fineness of the grinds are required (this one also doesn’t have a built-in grinder). Still, we were incredibly impressed with the espresso it pulled on the fourth try, with our tester saying it was “robust in taste and aromatics.” Notes like cocoa and sweet amaretto were identified — an incredibly impressive feat for an at-home machine. The body and crema were additionally outstanding. In fact, even with some inconsistencies in pressure and water flow, shots still came out tasting great.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The built-in frother was a bit temperamental with powerful steam and intense pressure that ended up producing more foam than hot milk. Users will likely need to experiment with water to test out its strength before moving on to milk.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Some features of this machine will remind the user that it’s a budget option — some parts (including the exterior) are made from flimsier plastic. And the inconsistency of the shot pour can be noticeable even if it doesn’t affect taste. Overall, though, it’s a solid beginner-friendly option that would even be great for more picky aficionados.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Grinder:</strong> No | <strong>Frother:</strong> Yes | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 11.22" H x 13.5" W x 8.07" D | <strong>Espresso Shot Pulls:</strong> Single and double | <strong>Machine Type:</strong> Semi-automatic</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-investment-rancilio-silvia-espresso-machine></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Investment</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Rancilio Silvia Espresso Machine</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Rancilio Silvia Espresso Machine" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/_xH-as4N3IpF3e7P5FOVMdqe7c8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Rancilio-Silvia-Espresso-Machine-b566db26e9ee4b34ab38ec6d208571c9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Use</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Ease of Cleaning</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=1><p>For those looking to have cafe-quality espresso at home, this is as close as you’ll get to a commercial-grade machine.</p></li><li readability=1><p>Everything about this stainless-steel machine – from the boiler to the compressor – is made of durable, high-quality materials.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking for the highest-quality machine on the market, the Rancilio Silvia Espresso Machine is as close to a commercial-grade machine that you can bring home. Just by looks alone, this resembles something you’d see in a cafe, from its durable stainless-steel exterior to its standard analog-style control panel. It has three switches for temperature, hot water, and steam, and a steam wand that’s controlled by a valve knob. If you’ve ever worked in a coffee shop, this will be an intuitive machine for you to use; and with a powerful compressor, this machine is leaps and bounds beyond a standard home model.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Once everything is set up (and set up, like most machines of this type, is a bit rigorous), it pulls tight, consistent espresso streams. We found that this espresso machine has incredible potential — but users should note that this machine is not only an investment in price, but it’s also an investment in time, as users will likely need to experiment with the grinds and the espresso pulls to produce a quality shot.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">After a few pulls with various rates of success, we found that it can be easy to under or over-extract shots, so some came out watery while others came out bitter. Once adjustments were made regarding the grind and the amount of coffee put into the machine, shots eventually came out with a firm crema and a rich body with notes of cherry. Still, Raub notes this isn’t uncommon: “Espresso is really inconsistent. Even if you have a high-end machine and a really high-end grinder that you're using with it, you can't expect perfection every single time.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The steam wand is also an excellent feature of this machine – the valve knob allows the user to control how much pressure is released, which can allow some customization with the thickness and richness of the foam. It reached temperature quickly, but that did not oversteam it or affect the texture. Again, because this is commercial-quality, it will create rich, velvety foam for cappuccinos or just a hint of foam for drinks like lattes.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re willing to learn and have the desire to create coffee drinks that rival your favorite cafe, this machine will take some learning — but once you master it, it’ll be well worth the effort.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Grinder:</strong> No | <strong>Frother:</strong> Yes | <strong>Dimensions:</strong> 13.3" H x 11.4" W x 9.2" D | <strong>Espresso Shot Pulls:</strong> Single and double | <strong>Machine Type:</strong> Semi-automatic</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-automatic-breville-barista-express-impress></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Automatic</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Breville Barista Express Impress</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Breville Barista Express Impress Espresso Machine" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/fLHinJX_KjLV6ByF0cmn9luSRjs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/breville-barista-express-impress-espresso-machine-brushed-stainless-steel-83878bffaf23475e9d6e2052c5bf26bc.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1.5><li readability=1><p>This Breville machine comes with a grinder, which means it’s an all-in-one option for perfect espresso drinks.</p></li><li readability=2><p>The automatic function on this machine remembers the previous dosage and tamp of an espresso shot, so once you find the settings you like, it’ll be easy to recreate.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=1><p>This is a large, bulky machine so it may not be the right fit for small apartments or kitchens with limited counter space.</p></li><li readability=0><p>At its price point, it’s an investment.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Simply put, an automatic espresso machine means that you start the espresso shot and the machine finishes it for you — and that’s part of the appeal of this Breville machine. Plus, it comes with a coffee grinder right on top. Additionally, the conical burr grinder has 25 different grind sizes and two options to control it – users can either adjust the wheel or adjust the tightness of the grinder itself to create a customized cup of espresso.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The first few pulls of espresso were watery and under-extracted, but when the grinder was manually dialed a few times, it eventually produced a “phenomenal fully manual pull that was perfectly extracted.” (That means it was easier to manually adjust the tamper to produce a superior espresso shot, rather than rely on automation.)</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, because the machine remembers the last setting, the shots pulled after were perfect as well, and the espresso itself was dark with a crema that had a lovely texture and no hint of sourness or bitterness. The machine also produced nice foam — when it was heated up to 130 degrees Fahrenheit, the microfoam was rich and had a pleasant texture and taste.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The machine itself is also fairly intuitive, with clearly labeled buttons and lights that make it quick to learn.

There’s also an internal grinder that has six different settings controlled by a turn dial, so you don’t need to pre-grind the coffee.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The espresso shots this machine produced were consistent once the tester set the grinder to 2.5 — only the first shot was under-extracted and watery. Afterward, all the shots produced had a dark brown crema with a well-balanced flavor that was sweet and featured a “pleasant slight bitterness.” This was also one of the most consistent machines tested, likely because it's a super-automatic model. The adjustable frother arm did emit a high temperature that made it easy to scald, but the flavor was still nice and the texture was velvety and creamy.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While this machine is also able to make coffee drinks, we were very happy with its intuitive programming that would likely be great for beginners — it’s easy to master this machine.

This isn’t a surprise given the brand, which is known for its high-end retro appliances. It comes in a few colorways, including red, black, and pastel green, and has a simple control panel that doesn’t distract from its aesthetic. This control panel consists of three buttons, including single shot, double shot, and steam.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Another benefit of this SMEG Espresso Machine is its ease of use: it’s simple to set up and a breeze to clean. Plus, it’s a great beginner machine that still pulls fairly excellent shots. During testing, it took a few tries to pull a shot that tasted good — before adjusting the grind, the first few shots were watery with no crema cap and a slightly burnt flavor — but after adjustments were made, shots were dark, full-bodied, rich in chocolate and caramel notes, and topped with a firm crema. Testers found the most success pulling single shots in the two-shot portafilter, finding that double shots were consistently underwhelming throughout the process. The steam wand was another plus for this machine, as it was quick to master: it took about 15 seconds to heat up and about 30 seconds to produce creamy, well-steamed milk with only occasional large airy bubbles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This machine's biggest draw remains its beautiful design, but it’s also a great machine for beginner users or those who have no interest in mastering the complexities of more difficult machines. If you’re looking for an efficient machine that makes quick lattes and looks nice on a countertop, it’s a great choice.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Grinder: </strong>No<strong> </strong>|<strong> Frother: </strong>Yes<strong> </strong>|<strong> Dimensions: </strong>13” H x 6” W x 12” D<strong> </strong>| <strong>Espresso Shot Pulls: </strong>Single and double<strong> </strong>|<strong> Machine Type: </strong>Automatic</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-compact-capresso-caf-ts-touchscreen-espresso-machine></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Compact</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Capresso Café TS Touchscreen Espresso Machine</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Capresso Caf&amp;Atilde;&amp;copy; TS Touchscreen Espresso Machine" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/5FszLiH8BLClr9H8WCbpTfmw-Xc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Capresso-Cafe-TS-Touchscreen-Espresso-Machine-bd11945f13f1413281119a21bacfdb69.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=0><p>This small machine is also beginner-friendly, while still producing delicious espresso shots.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>It’s also another fairly affordable option at under $200.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This small machine is great for kitchens with limited countertop space, and it’s also lightweight at only eight pounds.

The tester was also satisfied with the quality and the learning curve, finding the machine easy to master even if the user has no previous experience with making espresso.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The steam wand was not the Caspresso’s greatest asset: it has a smaller nozzle and because of that, it’s harder to use. The temperature only reached 101 degrees Fahrenheit, and the foam produced had some large, airy bubbles. There also was some trouble switching from the steam function to the espresso function — which could have been an issue with the particular machine that was tested, but it’s still important to mention.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Overall, this compact machine is effective at making high-quality espresso pulls no matter the user’s experience.

It's worth noting how much of each type of drink you can make at once, as well as what features the machine comes with: a built-in coffee grinder, a milk frother, a tamper, etc. Also, check to see if it requires any special filters and if it's a programmable model or adjusts automatically. You should know how much work will be involved with your machine every morning, as well as what additional equipment you will need (such as a good coffee grinder) to make that perfect shot of espresso.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Espresso Quality and Speed</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you're sacrificing your daily coffee run, you want to know you're still getting a high-quality product.

If you’re experiencing either of those issues, adjusting the water should give you a better shot. Finally, if you’re looking for the appropriate window of time a shot should take to pull, Raub says it should be around 25 to 30 seconds.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Ease of Cleaning</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">No one is looking for extra chores, so find out if the machine is easy to clean and if any of the parts are dishwasher-safe.

For a semi-automatic machine, you start and stop the shot. And for super-automatic machines, you simply push a button and the machine does all the work for you. Semi-automatics, according to Raub, are generally the default in espresso machines and work by pushing a button that opens the valve and starts the pump, meaning you have to also manually stop it to stop the pump.</p><p>While super-automatic machines take the least amount of user effort, Raub also notes that it’s “really hard to really change a lot of the espresso variables with those machines.” So if you’re looking for an incredibly bespoke cup of coffee, semi-automatics or automatics might be the best fit — and those looking for the easiest option will likely love a super-automatic.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" readability=-0.89407540394973><p><span class=accordion__title>Are coffee machines and espresso machines the same?</span></p><p>No, the machines required to make drip coffee and espresso coffee are different. The methods of preparation and the size of the grind differentiate the two. A <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>drip coffee maker</a> heats water and then disperses it over coarsely ground coffee and a filter. In comparison, an espresso coffee maker creates high pressure to force water quickly over tightly packed, finely ground coffee beans.

The fine grind of the beans and the lower water-to-bean ratio make espresso coffee thicker and stronger than regular coffee — and users should be expected to play with these elements to find the right cup of coffee for them.</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-trust-people></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--people commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Trust PEOPLE?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Alyssa Brascia</a> is a commerce writer for PEOPLE (and the original author of this article) with a background in lifestyle writing, spanning everything from beauty to home. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Alida Nugent</a> is a commerce contributor for PEOPLE with an extensive background in commerce writing, editing, and strategy.

Based on the results, we rate and recommend products so you can find the right one for your needs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But we don’t stop there: We also regularly re-review the categories in which we’ve awarded the PEOPLE Tested seal of approval — because the best product of today might not be the best of tomorrow. And by the way, companies can never buy our recommendation: Their products must earn it, fair and square.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In short, PEOPLE Tested provides recommendations you can trust — every day, every purchase.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ5akvKV7wZ6qrWWVqL2zsdKspmalkZi1qrrErGY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fbest-espresso-machines.html&text=The%207%20Best%20Espresso%20Machines%20of%202024%2c%20Tested%20and%20Reviewed&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbest-espresso-machines.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbest-espresso-machines.html&title=The%207%20Best%20Espresso%20Machines%20of%202024%2c%20Tested%20and%20Reviewed" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fbest-espresso-machines.html&title=The%207%20Best%20Espresso%20Machines%20of%202024%2c%20Tested%20and%20Reviewed" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fbest-espresso-machines.html&title=The%207%20Best%20Espresso%20Machines%20of%202024%2c%20Tested%20and%20Reviewed" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbest-espresso-machines.html&description=The%207%20Best%20Espresso%20Machines%20of%202024%2c%20Tested%20and%20Reviewed" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./miley-cyrus-celebrates-18th-birthday-with-friends-family-cupcake.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Avan Jogia Wishes Miley Cyrus Happy, Kiss-Filled Birthday!">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./mandy-moore-weekend-upstate-new-york-sons-see-snow-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Mandy Moore's Sons See Snow for First Time on Family Trip: Photos">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
