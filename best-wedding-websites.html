Once you've got the layout of your website down, you can match digital and print invites to your site's theme, manage guest lists and RSVPs, create itineraries, set up a registry or cash fund, and add hotel, restaurant, or sight-seeing recommendations near your venue. While some wedding websites have a monthly or annual fee for their services, most are actually free to use.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As online wedding planning has grown in popularity over the years, so has the number of wedding websites.

Though the site's services are not free, you can test the waters with a seven-day free trial.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price: </strong>$12/month standard plan; $18/month premium plan | <strong>Custom Domain?</strong> Yes, included in plan | <strong>Wedding Invites?</strong> Yes, digital</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-multilingual-weddings-wedsites></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Best for Multilingual Weddings: WedSites</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>WedSites</span></figure><span class="people-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="people-sc-block-comparisonlist__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>Translate your wedding websites into multiple language<br></p></li><li readability=-1><p>Invitation and RSVP translation available</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Comprehensive planning tools with paid options</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-it-made-the-list></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why It Made the List</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-53 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A wedding is an event that should be enjoyed by people from around the world who speak <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>multiple languages</a>, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>WedSites</a> makes the process of building a website and creating invitations seamless for multilingual weddings. Wedsites has a lot of free offerings, like a wedding website with free hosting and access to template designs, but the site's extensive and noteworthy features are only available with its two paid options — the $99 standard plan includes a guest list database and RSVP tracking, but the $199 pro plan has the most services.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With all tiers, you can choose from over 30 predesigned templates, which can be customized by color, font, accents, etc. Along with the design options, Wedsites' pro plan not only offers event planning tools, which include a checklist, budget calculator, seating chart builder, and vendor payment reminders, but it also simplifies translating your website with easy navigation tools. As you build your website, you can switch its language according to the country or countries your guests are traveling from with the click of a button. The multilingual services don't stop there; in addition to the website language switcher, you can also assign preferred languages to guests and translate digital invites and RSVPs. The best part? There is no limit to the number of languages you can translate to.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price: </strong>Free; $99 standard plan; $199 pro plan | <strong>Custom Domain?</strong> Yes, included in plan | <strong>Wedding Invites?</strong> Yes, digital</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-online-tools-weddingwire></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Best Online Tools: WeddingWire</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>WeddingWire</span></figure><span class="people-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="people-sc-block-comparisonlist__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1><li readability=1><p>Free communication, budget, and planning tools<br></p></li><li readability=-1><p>100+ design templates to choose from</p></li><li readability=-1><p>Companion app convenient for event management</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-it-made-the-list></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-list-item-title mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why It Made the List</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to free wedding websites, it doesn't get any better than <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow">WeddingWire</a>. The site has extensive planning tools that help guide you through every step of your wedding journey. Building a website with WeddingWire is free, though you can opt to get a custom domain for $24. With over 100 custom templates to choose from, you can modify your website theme, color style, font, header and footer, and more to your liking. The site does not match your website to invites or stationary, though, but this small letdown is outshined by the number of free planning tools it offers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you need help with finding a vendor or managing your seating chart, WeddingWire has a tool for that too. The site's interactive checklist tool builds a schedule for any events surrounding your wedding, which you can edit along the way. For anything involving your guests, the guest list manager imports contacts and updates RSVPs as reservations are made or canceled, and even syncs your list to a floor plan to build a seating chart. Tracking your budget is easy with the WeddingWire budgeting tool, which estimates category costs based on the budget you provide, and tracks services you've paid for. While you have to manually add accommodations like travel and local to-dos, WeddingWire does give you the option to unlock special hotel rates for guests.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Price: </strong>Free | <strong>Custom Domain?</strong> Yes ($24) | <strong>Wedding Invites?</strong> Yes, digital and print</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-final-verdict></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Final Verdict</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow data-affiliate-link-rewriter="subid1=${DOC_ID}&subid2=${REQUEST_ID}">Joy</a> stole the show as the best wedding website for its variety of design templates, customization options, and planning tools.

Many sites have free website builders, which will typically come with free designs and templates, tools, and more. Other sites, like Riley & Grey, require a monthly or yearly payment for website-building services. Custom domains, however, will always need to be purchased even if a wedding website itself offers a free plan.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>When should you set up a wedding website?</span></p><p>Generally speaking, it is a good idea to start setting up your wedding website at least six months before your wedding date, though some experts recommend starting as early as nine to 12 months ahead of your special day. Having your website up and running months ahead of your wedding gives your guests enough time to RSVP and plan for the event, which subsequently helps you better plan for the ceremony, reception, and everything else.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>How can I make my wedding website unique?</span></p><p>There are endless ways to personalize your wedding website. While many websites have predesigned templates, you can go the extra mile and customize your website by changing the theme colors and fonts, adding sentimental pictures and videos, and posting a time line of your relationship journey in a heartfelt text post. For the tech-savvy soon-to-be newlyweds, some sites offer CSS customization for advanced site-building.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>What is a good wedding URL?</span></p><p>Ideally, you want your wedding website URL to include specifics, like your and your partner's names, a surname, both surnames, and so forth. If you or your partner have common names, the URL you want might not be available. In this case, opt for a nickname or a play on one of your names, include keywords like "wedding" with your first or last names, or add the destination of your wedding with a surname. A good rule of thumb is to keep your URL short and simple (no symbols or intentional misspellings).</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>When should you share your wedding website?</span></p><p>You should share your wedding website as soon as you have finished adding your desired information and customizing it to your liking. The sooner you can do this, the better, but it should be no later than six months before your wedding date. If you can plan ahead and share your live website nine to 12 months before you say "I do," even better.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item" readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Can you have guests RSVP on a wedding website?</span></p><p>Most wedding websites offer a free RSVP management tool with your website. With this type of system, guests can send in contact information like an address, phone number, and email, as well as dietary preferences/restrictions, and names of plus ones. You can view and manage guest information, including reservation decisions, as they input these details on your site.</p></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-methodology></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Methodology</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To compile this list, our team carefully researched over a dozen wedding websites.
