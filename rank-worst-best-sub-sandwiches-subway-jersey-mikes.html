Jersey Mike's</h2><p>Mashed ranked this <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">chain</a> with more than 2,000 locations nationwide top of the list, even though it may not be the first choice that comes to mind.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="More on sandwich chains">More on sandwich chains</h2><p>The food site raved about the "meats and cheeses that are sliced in front of you when you order," and the fact that ingredients are often locally sourced.</p><p>Importantly, it said the chain offers "an amazing selection of both hot and cold sandwiches," and highlighted the "special mixture of olive oil and vinegar that blesses the sandwiches" you order there.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in MONEY</h2></p><h2>2. Publix Deli</h2><p>This was an interesting choice because <a href=# rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">Publix Deli</a> is not located in every state. In fact you see them mostly in the southeast, including in <a href=#>Florida</a>, Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina.</p><p>According to Mashed, the brand didn't make the top spot because "the grocery store's locations are so limited in scope."</p><p>Otherwise, it said many publications stated "it takes the cake for the best sub in the country."</p><h2>3. Au Bon Pain</h2><p>This chain was bought by <a href=#>Panera</a> in 2017 before announcing it was selling it to Ampex, a franchisee that owns hundreds of <a href=#>Pizza Hut</a>, KFC and <a href=#>Taco Bell</a> locations.</p><p>Mashed liked the fast-casual brand saying, "from the spicy tuna melt to the country grilled cheese, you know you're going to get a fantastic sandwich made with high-quality bread."</p><h2>4. Jimmy John's</h2><p>This popular chain ranked high up, in part because of its "super easy to order" system, as well as the diverse sandwich selection.</p><p>Mashed recommended trying "one of the more creative options available there, such as the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vito</a> or the Jimmy Cubano."</p><h2>5. Firehouse Subs</h2><p>There are more than <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">1,200</a> locations across the country, with most concentrated in Florida, which accounts for about 15% of all its US outlets.</p><p>Sandwiches can cost more than if you go to your local Subway, but according Mashed, that's because "you're going to be getting a higher-quality product."</p><p>The site says it has a reputation for using high quality meats and cheeses.</p><p>The chain just opened a new location in <a href=#>Ohio</a> last week.</p><h2>6. Pret a manger</h2><p>This is actually a UK based sandwich shop, but has nearly 600 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">locations</a> in 11 countries, including here in the US, as well as in France and China.</p><p>Most US locations are located on the East Coast, with a predominance in <a href=#>New York</a>.</p><p>The prices are not cheap with half sandwiches (yes, that's an option) starting at $5.79 for its light egg salad and arugula option, but full sandwiches can cost more.</p><p>Mashed suggests trying the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bang Bang Chicken Wrap</a>.</p><p>At $11.49, before tax, it comes with gochujang aioli and miso sesame dressing drizzled over chicken and crispy onions.</p><p>If you want a European-type sandwich experience, this is worth a try.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/07/NINTCHDBPICT000746538526.jpg><h2>7. Potbelly Sandwich Shop</h2><p>This chain just made a lot of loyal customers happy by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">bringing</a> back its gyro flat sandwich, filled with lamb and beef topped with a tangy tzatziki sauce and feta, onion and tomato on a flatbread.</p><p>It returns for a limited time after its first run back in 2018.</p><p>The <a href=#>Chicago</a>-based chain said in March it plans to grow from 440 locations to 2,000 shops across the country.</p><p>Mashed liked the fact there are so many options available.</p><h2>8. Schlotzsky's</h2><p>This is a fast-casual restaurant franchise that started in Austin, <a href=#>Texas</a> in 1971.</p><p>It has nearly 350 locations nationwide, with many locations in the Midwest and South.</p><p>Mashed described the options here as "pretty basic," though it said the "French Dip might we worth a try."</p><h2>9. Corner Bakery Cafe</h2><p>According to its website, this Dallas, Texas based chain specializes in pastries, breads, breakfast dishes and gourmet sandwiches, as well as homemade soups and salads.</p><p>A large number of locations are can be found in <a href=#>California</a>, Texas, Pennsylvania and Illinois.</p><p>Mashed characterized the sandwiches here as the brand's "bread and butter."</p><p>However, it said some were better than others. While it said it could "take or leave the tomato mozzarella," it did like the brand's steak and arugula sub, calling it "fantastic."</p><h2>10. Atlanta Bread Company</h2><p>This is a smaller chain with locations across four states.</p><p>According to its <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">website</a>, the bread it uses is baked fresh every morning.</p><p>Despite that Mashed said their sandwiches were "hit-or-miss," calling some of them "basic."</p><p>It said: "The classic sandwiches are downright boring. You get to choose your bread and meat, but they all come with onion, tomato, lettuce, mayonnaise, and spicy mustard."</p><p>"Basically, they're simple sandwiches you could easily make at home," according to Mashed.</p><p>It did tout its paninis as being something to try.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/07/NINTCHDBPICT000746538468.jpg><h2>11. Panera</h2><p><a href=#>Panera</a> has more than 2,000 locations in the US and recently gave up a bid to become a public company - again - via a special purpose acquisition deal (SPAC) with restauranteur Danny Meyer.</p><p>The company has been privately held since 2017.</p><p>Mashed described its options as bland and said the meat was "dry" on its Smokehouse BBQ Chicken sandwich.</p><h2>12. Which Wich</h2><p>This is a Dallas, Texas based chain with domestic and international locations, including in the UK, Guatemala and Saudi Arabia.</p><p>Per Mashed, the chain makes it easy to order and has lots of options, but said they are not "compelling."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/07/NINTCHDBPICT000746538371.jpg><h2>13. Quiznos</h2><p>The <a href=#>fast-food</a> chain has been struggling after a staggering series of losses caused it to shut more than 90% of its locations, which at one time numbered about 5,000.</p><p>It now has less than 175 outlets nationwide.</p><p>According to Mashed, part of the problem is the "higher prices," compared to an average Subway store.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/07/NINTCHDBPICT000746538260.jpg><h2>14. Blimpie</h2><p>Mashed liked the "welcoming atmosphere" Blimpie offers, but not much else.</p><p>The chain is based in <a href=#>Arizona</a> and was founded in Hoboken, New Jersey by three friends in 1964.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.the-sun.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2022/07/NINTCHDBPICT000262974624.jpg><h2>15. Subway</h2><p>And, per Mashed, the worst on the ranking - <a href=#>Subway</a>.</p><p>The multi-national is primarily known for its submarine sandwiches, wraps, salads and beverages.</p><p>It has more than 40,000 locations in more than 100 countries.</p><p>Despite being one of the most recognized sub-sandwich brands, if not the most, Mashed was not impressed.</p><p>It pointed out <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">scandals</a> that have been widely publicized embroiling the chain, including one where the meat it served up was not the meat it advertised tied to its chicken and tuna.</p><p>Mashed said: "The vegetables often look limp and sad, and sometimes, you can tell that they've been sitting there for a long time. The meat is just average deli meat you can find at any grocery store."</p><p>Trying to overcome years of declines, it recently introduced 12 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">new</a> sub offerings.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More On The Sun">Read More On The Sun</h2><p>Here's more on when <a href=#>Hardee's</a> stops serving breakfast.</p><p>Plus, a deals expert shares <a href=#>tips</a> on how to save money when buying fast food</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEZqqupl6YvK57zKilnrFfaoR1hZdwaWiqkaO4bsPOq6qtZZKawLV50q6ZZquRo7G4tcKhnKxlo6qvuK3YZqGeqqOaxm65yKScrGc%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2frank-worst-best-sub-sandwiches-subway-jersey-mikes.html&text=We%20tried%2015%20sub%20sandwiches%2c%20including%20Subway%2c%20and%20the%20worst%20one%20may%20surprise%20you%20-%20see%20how%20they%20rank&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2frank-worst-best-sub-sandwiches-subway-jersey-mikes.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2frank-worst-best-sub-sandwiches-subway-jersey-mikes.html&title=We%20tried%2015%20sub%20sandwiches%2c%20including%20Subway%2c%20and%20the%20worst%20one%20may%20surprise%20you%20-%20see%20how%20they%20rank" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2frank-worst-best-sub-sandwiches-subway-jersey-mikes.html&title=We%20tried%2015%20sub%20sandwiches%2c%20including%20Subway%2c%20and%20the%20worst%20one%20may%20surprise%20you%20-%20see%20how%20they%20rank" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2frank-worst-best-sub-sandwiches-subway-jersey-mikes.html&title=We%20tried%2015%20sub%20sandwiches%2c%20including%20Subway%2c%20and%20the%20worst%20one%20may%20surprise%20you%20-%20see%20how%20they%20rank" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2frank-worst-best-sub-sandwiches-subway-jersey-mikes.html&description=We%20tried%2015%20sub%20sandwiches%2c%20including%20Subway%2c%20and%20the%20worst%20one%20may%20surprise%20you%20-%20see%20how%20they%20rank" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./emmerdale-coronation-street-schedule-shake-up.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Emmerdale and Coronation Street rocked by ITV schedule shake-up next week">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./vanessa-williams-white-bikini-beach-photo.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Vanessa Williams Confidently Poses In White Bikini On Beach  Hollywood Life">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
